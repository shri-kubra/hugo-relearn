# Introduction to Self-Serve Pricing

The CLEAR self-service pricing module allows utility employees to update pricing in CLEAR. This helps consumers more accurately estimate their water bill and receive notifications based on when their estimated bill reaches a threshold.

## Navigate to the Pricing Module

1. Log in to the [Dropcountr CLEAR dashboard](https://dropcountr.com/clear).
2. On the left menu bar, click **Pricings**. 
3. Click a pricing option to view existing pricing. The updated view allows you to see each version of pricing information separately. 
4. Click the **Expand** (+) button to view an expanded list showing the current pricing information and all historical versions.

## Adding a New Pricing

To add a new pricing, follow the steps below:

1. Click the **\+Add** button. A menu will appear on the right side of the screen.
2. Enter a unique **Name** and **Import Code** in the open right panel. The import code must match the pricing ID  sent with service connection files or fetched from the smart meterâ€™s API.
3. Select the appropriate **Billing Unit**.
4. Select the appropriate **Billing Period**. The billing period should be the frequency at which your utility sends out bills. 

**Note**: Consumers will see usage graphs displaying the billing unit. If the billing unit is not set to gallons, usage will be shown in that unit in addition to gallons.

### Adding Budget-Based Tiers

**Note**: Any information you have entered will not be saved if you switch between volumetric and budget-based.

1. Select the **Budget-Based** radio button in the **Tiers** section. This will create three default tiers based on common setups: 1 indoor budget, 1 outdoor budget, and anything above.  
2. Click **Add Tier** to insert rows for each pricing tier.  
3. Click the trash icon under the **Action** column to delete the row if needed.

**Note:** You must have at least two budget-based tiers, including the **anything above** tier.

## Fallback Pricing

When utilities send KUBRA their list of service connections, each connection should include the associated pricing code. If a pricing code is not present, KUBRA will use the fallback pricing code. We recommend adding one with the **Import Code** set to _fallback_ to account for any service connections without an associated pricing code.
