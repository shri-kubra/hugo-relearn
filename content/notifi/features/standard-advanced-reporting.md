## Standard Reporting ##

Standard Reporting for Notifi is included as a [Reports tool](/notifi/management-console/reports) in the Management Console for Notifi. The Reports tool provides a set of report dashboards configured to provide information about operations that have occurred within the Notifi system.

Dashboards can be exported as PDF files for review offline. KUBRA can also set up PDF files of individual dashboards to be delivered via email as part of an implementation project. Data from individual charts can be exported in TXT, Excel, CSV, JSON, HTML, or Markdown format. Dashboards can be exported in PDF or CSV format.

The standard dashboards include filters by date, communication channel, location, and operating company. Some filters are only available if the organization provides related customer account data to Notifi.

There is no limit to the number of users who can have access to the Standard Reporting features.

## Advanced Reporting ##

Advanced Reporting provides drill-down access to reports within the standard dashboards.

Advanced Reporting users can:

+ Access the raw dataset and data schema behind each dashboard (the Explorer toolset)
+ Create custom reports based on multiple dimensions and measurements — this includes the ability to change the reports included in Standard Reporting
+ Share custom reports with other Advanced Reporting users as a URL
+ Schedule dashboard or report data to be delivered via email, SFTP, webhook, or Amazon S3 (every 5 minutes, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly; option to only send a report “if results have changed”)

By default, Advanced Reporting includes access for up to 10 users. Additional user licenses can be purchased in groups of 10.
