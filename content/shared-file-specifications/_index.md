Some file types are shared by multiple KUBRA products. We provide these file specifications in this section to indicate that they are shared by multiple products.

Not all products use all elements of a shared file type. Elements that are product-specific are noted in the file specification notes.

There are currently two shared file specifications for KUBRA products documented on this site:

+ [**Outage files**](/shared-file-specifications/outage-file) - These files list outages affecting delivery nodes in a region and provide information about each outage such as an estimated restoration time, cause, comments, and repair crew status.
+ [**Planned outage files**](/shared-file-specifications/planned-outage-file) - These files list outages that have an estimated start and end time because they are planned in advance. They also provide information about each outage such as a duration, the number of customers affected, comments, and an area affected by the outage.

For all data files, you must follow the KUBRA-provided data specifications. For example, all coordinate data must be provided according to EPSG:4326, also known as WGS84.

This section also includes [Image Resource Manager](/shared-file-specifications/image-resource-manager), a tool to help with image uploads on the products.
