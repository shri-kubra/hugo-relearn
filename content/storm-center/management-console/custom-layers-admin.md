## Information Areas ##

An **Information Area** is a shape that you can draw on the map to represent locations for items such as gas leaks, flood zones, an estimated restoration time for multiple counties or towns (or another kind of area), or reliability improvement work. Each information area shape is shaded using one of seven colors: blue, green, orange, purple, red, yellow, or gray. Details about the area are provided in an information panel when a user clicks or taps the information area on the map.

## Information Points ##

An **Information Point** is an icon that you can add to the map to represent locations for items such as ice trucks, outreach vans, or shelters. Each icon uses one of twenty-eight shapes. Details about the location are provided in an information panel when a user clicks or taps on the information point icon on the map.

## Configure Settings for Custom Layers ##

Provide a title for Information Areas and a title for Information Points to be used on the map for each language supported by the map.

To enable Information Areas, click the **Enable Information Areas?** checkbox. To enable Information Points, click the **Enable Information Points?** checkbox.
