Notifi uses business data from back-end systems to deliver messages to customers on a variety of communication channels according to customer preferences. Notifi also allows customers to request information and complete transactions such as outage reports and payment authorizations using automated SMS text conversations.\nTo put it another way, Notifi collects information about customers’ communication preferences and then “listens in” on business activities to update customers when something happens which is of interest to them. Notifi can also retrieve information from other systems to answer customer questions or collect information from a customer to send to other systems to help a customer complete an account-related task.\nThe Notifi product uses a combination of single-tenant and multi-tenant architecture supported by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Although data is kept in shared data centers by AWS, KUBRA data is logically separated on virtualized hardware using AWS account management tools. Multi-tenant pieces of the Notifi architecture logically separate data using unique identifiers for each client. Access to all data managed by KUBRA is restricted using both the client identifier and permissions in user tokens. Our authentication vendor provides cryptographically signed user tokens to each user when the user signs in.\nBenefits of Notifi Benefits Multiple alert types Supports messages about bills, payments, account status, service requests, outages, and more Multiple contact channels Includes SMS text, email, voice, and app push notification Single source of communication preferences The Notifi Preference Center UI gives customers an easy way to add and manage contact information and alert preferences on desktop and mobile web browsers and in mobile apps for Android and iOS Bilingual support Customers can select English or Spanish preference for each contact (phone number, email address, or phone ID) Robust administration tools Notifi Management Console includes tools for sending ad hoc messages, temporarily pausing message delivery by type or channel, and reviewing system activity Durable and scalable infrastructure Amazon Web Services resources adjust to support user traffic while taking advantage of economies of scale Admin Tools Notifi includes a management console UI with tools available to an organization’s admin users. This management console provides a tool for managing admin user accounts. In addition, the Notifi product includes the following admin tools:\nPreferences — allows users to look up a customer account number and view a version of the Preference Center interface with the current contact and preference information for that account (users can also make changes to contact or preference information) History — shows a history of all messages sent and received by the Notifi system, searchable by Account, Contact, Alert Type, Delivery Method, or Delivery Status Broadcast — allows users to create ad hoc email, voice, and/or SMS text messages and send them to all customers or to a selected user group (the Broadcast tool has the same available channels as the supported channels configured for the rest of the Notifi system) Template Manager — allows users to view and edit message templates for proactive messages and submit edits for review and promotion from development to test or from test to production Admin — allows users to temporarily “mute” all messages or messages with a selected message type Reports — shows graphs, charts, and tables with summary and timeline data of communications to customers Advanced Reporting — an optional addition to the Reports tool that allows users to view additional data, create custom reports, and schedule reports for delivery by email Enrollments — allows users to look up a customer account number and see a list of all changes to enrollments for contacts registered to that account",

    "content": "What is Storm Center? Storm Center is KUBRA’s online outage map product. Storm Center uses outage data provided by an organization such as a utility company to show information about power outages on an interactive online map. Customers can access the map from a link on the utility’s website to see information about outages in their area or across the utility’s service territory.\nThe Storm Center product is deployed on a multi-tenant architecture supported by Amazon Web Services. All clients (utility companies) who use Storm Center to create maps for their customers use the same Production environment but have separate instances. A single client can have multiple instances, such as an instance for testing configurations or data feeds and an instance for live maps. Each instance can include multiple maps, such as a map for the public, a map for inclusion in a mobile app, and a map for employees.\nBenefits of Storm Center Benefits Quick implementation Instance Manager makes it easy to set up and launch a new map Highly configurable Instance Manager includes many options for controlling data and views on a map Flexible structure Supports multiple maps for different audiences that use the same data feeds, map layouts with or without a header, and multiple options for embedding maps in websites and applications Durable and scalable infrastructure Amazon Web Services resources adjust to support user traffic while taking advantage of economies of scale Standardized features Based on KUBRA’s years of experience building outage maps for utilities Mobile-friendly design Allows customers to access maps from desktop and mobile web browsers Multilingual interface Map and information can be displayed in English, French, and Spanish Ongoing updates Multi-tenant architecture allows KUBRA to provide updates to all clients at the same time without altering production map configurations Interactive Map with Responsive Design The Google Maps API provides the background map. The map interface allows users to search for an address, use location services to zoom to their current location, or pan and zoom manually. Responsive design supports both desktop and mobile web browsers, which is especially important for customers experiencing power outages, who may only be able to view the map from a mobile device using cellular data for internet access.\nStorm Center maps can show outage data in two main ways: by location and by area. All views include information panels with information about outages, such as\nthe number of customers affected an estimated restoration time the cause of the outage the start time of the outage An organization using Storm Center can choose which types of information to provide in the information panels based on the data available in an Outage Management System or other outage data source.\nOutage Information by Location Storm Center maps represent outage locations using icons with color coding and shapes based on the number of customers affected by the outage. At zoom levels that show a bigger area such as an entire state or multiple states, outage location icons which are close together are grouped into cluster icons. Outage clustering is based on the distance between outage location icons at a particular zoom level, screen size, and browser window size. Different devices may therefore see different arrangements of cluster icons.\nOutage Information by Area Storm Center maps represent outage locations by area using color-coded shading based on the number or the percentage of customers affected by outages in the area. A Storm Center map can have more than one type of area represented, so users can switch between viewing outages by county and viewing outages by ZIP code, for example.\nMaps with Access Restrictions Storm Center supports both public maps and “internal” maps or other maps that include access restrictions. This allows authorized users to access a different map than the general public, which can include additional information such as outage ID numbers and internal comments. By default, users are logged out of maps with access restrictions after 2 hours of inactivity.\nSupported Browsers KUBRA strives to provide compatibility with a range of browsers to make our software widely accessible while also using modern web design and security practices that may limit compatibility with some legacy browsers. For Storm Center maps, the following browsers are officially supported.\nDesktop Browsers Google Chrome - current version and previous version Mozilla Firefox - current version and previous version Apple Safari - current version and previous version on Mac OS X Microsoft Edge - current version Mobile Device Browsers For mobile devices, support is limited to the stock web browser installed on the device by the manufacturer.\nGoogle Android - current version of Chrome on Android 4.4+ Apple iOS - Mobile Safari on the current and previous major versions of iOS Note\rStorm Center 5 does not support landscape mode in mobile devices.\nAdmin Features The Storm Center product includes a management console called Control Center. Control Center allows admin users at a utility to manage some of the configurable features of their deployed maps.\nControl Center includes tools for managing\nUpdate Interval Note - tells users of the map how often data on the map is updated Page Mode - allows a different default map view choice for blue-sky or storm situations, as well as URL redirects for map maintenance Alert Banner - a banner at the top or bottom of the map with a link to a longer alert message that can communicate storm updates, upcoming maintenance, etc. Custom Layers - ad hoc icons and area shading that can provide information about ice distribution, shelters, flood zones, etc. Overwritten Data - allows administrators to overwrite Estimated Restoration Times, Customers Affected numbers, or both for the individual areas on the map Storm Center also includes an admin tool for viewing historical outage data. This Map History tool allows administrators to review outage data from up to five years ago on a map interface similar to a Storm Center outage map.\nNote\rSome admin features are provided as additional-cost modules to the Storm Center product.\nImplementing Storm Center To set up a new Storm Center instance, start by reviewing the Getting Started document.",

This means that users can either use keywords or complete sentences to request information or complete supported tasks.\nMessage Categories Notifi supports a wide variety of message categories for both proactive messages (one-way) and interactive automated conversations (two-way).\nAccount Messages Proactive message types for account messages include\nContact Information Updated New Contact Registration Start Service Confirmation Stop Service Confirmation New Contact Confirmation New Contact Affirmation Two-way message topics for account messages include\nREG or JOIN - register a new contact SUB - add a message category subscription to a contact NICK - add a nickname for an account HELP - request a list of valid SMS keywords STOP or CANCEL - unsubscribe from one or all message categories PAUSE/RESUME - stop/restart proactive message delivery to the contact Billing and Payment Messages Proactive message types for billing and payment messages include\nStatement Available Bill Due Payment Processed - Success Payment Processed - Failure Payment Overdue Disconnect Pending Balance Billing Adjustment Critical Peak Pricing Alert Threshold Balance Alert Two-way message topics for billing and payment messages include\nBAL - request current account balance PAY - authorize payment (using payment method on file) Prepaid Account Messages Proactive message types for prepaid account messages include\nAnnual Program Confirmation Program Enrollment Confirmation Program Cancellation Low Balance Payment Confirmation Payment Reversal Disconnect Pending Disconnect Completed Payment Confirmation - Sufficient Amount Payment Confirmation - Insufficient Amount Weekly Bill-to-Date Outage Messages Proactive message types for outage messages include\nOutage Detected Outage Updated (estimated restoration time, crew status, cause) Outage Restored Severe Weather Alert Planned Outage Alert Two-way message topics for outage messages include\nOUT - report an outage (for the user’s account) STAT - request the status of an outage affecting the user’s account Usage Messages Proactive message types for usage messages include\nWeekly Usage Summary Threshold Usage Alert Two-way message topics for usage messages include\nUSE - request current usage information Other Message Categories KUBRA can configure additional message categories and templates for the Notifi system as part of an implementation project.\nPreference Center The Notifi Preference Center UI is designed to integrate with a “My Account” web portal. Customers who sign in and access the Preference Center can add new contact information, remove contacts, and manage preferences and settings for existing contacts.\nUsers can opt in or opt out of message categories for each contact registered to an account. They can also provide a language preference for each contact and set a Do Not Disturb period for each contact.\nSome message categories have additional settings, such as bill due date thresholds, cost thresholds, or usage thresholds. Users can set these thresholds by account; the same setting applies for all contacts registered to the account and enrolled to receive the message category.\nBusiness Rules Default and Supplemental Contacts Notifi supports default contacts and supplemental contacts, which handle messaging in situations outside of the typical opt in. Default contacts are used in cases where an account does not have registered contacts in the Notifi system, or where an account does not have an enrollment for the message category being sent. Supplemental contacts are used in addition to the customer contacts registered in the Notifi system.\nNote\rThe organization using the Notifi system is required to abide by the TCPA, the CAN-SPAM Act, and any local regulations with respect to opt-in status when passing default and supplemental contacts to the Notifi system for message delivery.\nFor more information, see the Default and Supplemental Contacts page page.\nAggregated Messaging Notifi provides aggregated messaging designed to improve the customer experience by eliminating overly similar messages sent to a single contact. Message aggregation is limited to event data sent in a single batch file, or to event data sent via web service and labeled as a single data batch.\nFor more information, see the Aggregated Messaging page.\nExcessive Messaging Protection Notifi provides excessive messaging protection designed to improve the customer experience by providing messaging caps for messages to a customer contact. KUBRA can configure Notifi to pause delivery of further SMS or email messages for a set period of time after a specific contact receives more than a specified number of messages in a specified time window (such as more than 10 messages in one hour).\nFor voice messages, additional messages over the configured threshold include an option for the customer to pause delivery of further messages (for example, “press 1 to temporarily stop receiving calls from ABC Company”).\nFor more information, see the Excessive Messaging Protection page.\nETR Change for Outage Alert KUBRA can configure how large of a change in estimated restoration time is needed to send an outage update message to customers.\nAdditional Cost Modules High-Capacity Voice Message Delivery KUBRA provides options for increasing voice message delivery to between 15 and 30 new calls started per second depending on implementation requirements.\nAdvanced Reporting The Notifi Advanced Reporting module includes 10 user licenses and adds support for additional features and access in the Reports admin tool. Additional features include custom report creation and report scheduling and delivery options.\nKUBRA also provides additional user licenses for Advanced Reporting in sets of 10.\nFor more information on the difference between our Standard and Advanced Reporting options, see the Standard and Advanced Reporting page.\nMobile App SDK KUBRA provides a Notifi Mobile App SDK for integrating Notifi preference management features with native mobile apps for Android and iOS. The SDK can be licensed for use with KUBRA iMobile apps or with third-party apps.\nNotifi Deregistration Manager The Notifi Deregistration Manager service identifies and deregisters contacts in Notifi environments according to configurable rules. The Deregistration Manager currently includes features for managing unconfirmed contacts, managing disconnected or reassigned phone numbers, and distinguishing between landline and mobile devices by phone number.\nFor more information, see the Notifi Deregistration Manager page.",

KUBRA periodically releases new features for the Storm Center solution and may include a preview of the new features for non-critical instances before releasing the new features to all instances.\nThe following diagram shows the different parts of the Storm Center map interface. Storm Center maps can be configured with or without a map header.\nMap Header, Overview Panel, and Help Panel If the map includes a map header, the header can optionally include link buttons, social media icon buttons, and a company logo with a hyperlink. On smaller screens, the link buttons and social media icon buttons are included in the overview panel.\nIf the map does not include a map header, configured link buttons and social media icon buttons will appear in the overview panel at all screen sizes.\nThe overview panel and the help panel open to the left side of the map.\nOverview Panel The overview panel button opens the overview panel. This button has a configurable icon and can optionally include a text label such as “Menu.”\nThe overview panel includes summary outage information, links to outage summary reports, and weather radar settings. The overview panel can optionally include configurable content blocks and button links.\nSummary Outage Information Label The overview panel can optionally include a text label above the summary outage information, such as “Summary,” the name of the organization, or a name for the map. If the organization has multiple operating companies or Regions, the overview panel can include separate information for each region or combined information for all regions.\nSummary Outage Information The summary outage information in the overview panel can include the total number of active outages, the total number of customers affected by active outages, and the total number of customers served.\nBelow the summary information, the overview panel shows the date and time at which information on the map was last updated and a note about how often information on the map is updated. The last updated timestamp is based on the time when data processing is completed for the most recent file submitted to the outage data feed. Admin users can manage the update frequency note in the Storm Center Settings app.\nNote\rThe summary information in the overview panel is based only on active outage data, that is, data from files submitted to the Outage data feed. It does not include information from files submitted to the Planned Outage data feed.\nThe organization can optionally include a content block below the summary information and above the rest of the content in the overview panel. This content block can include text, links, and images. Note\rWhen using images inside content blocks, please upload images using Image Resource Manager, then reference the path URL for that image in the content blocks. Specifically, use the Link section when adding images to reference the path URL.\nSummary Reports The Summary section of the overview panel includes links to summary reports. The summary reports show the number of customers affected by active outages per area (county, postal code, or city/town/village) and overall, as well as the latest estimated restoration time for outages in each area.\nThe bottom of each summary report includes the date and time at which information was last updated and a note about how often information is updated. The last updated timestamp and update frequency note at the bottom of summary reports are the same as in the top section of the overview panel.\nSummary reports can optionally include a description at the top of the report that can include hyperlinks or click-to-call links for phone numbers.\nSummary reports can optionally include a button to allow users to download a copy of the data in the report as a CSV file.\nWeather (Optional) The Weather section of the overview panel includes tools for viewing weather radar information on the map. Users can turn static weather radar and radar animation on or off and adjust the opacity of the weather radar layer.\nAdditional Content The overview panel can also include one or more configurable link buttons or content blocks below the Summary and Weather tools. For example, the overview panel can include links to an information page about the outage restoration process or contact information for the organization providing the map.\nHelp Panel The help panel is optional. If included, it can show one or more configurable link buttons, one or more configurable content blocks, or any combination of buttons and content blocks. For example, the help panel can provide tips for using the map, information about other resources, and links to web pages such as a help page or a page with additional information.\nMap Legend The map legend defines the color-coding used for outage icons, area polygons, and the service territory boundary. If a map uses icons to indicate the presence of a crew at an outage location, the crew symbol also appears in the map legend.\nThe map legend card also includes the controls for map views, custom layers, and the service territory boundary.\nMap Views Users can switch between map views using radio buttons or a selector on the map legend card. Map view choices include Location, County, ZIP or Postal Code, and City/Town/Village (CTV). If a map includes planned outage data, Planned Outages can appear as a map view choice. When a user changes the map view, the legend icons also change to match the selected map view.\nCustom Layers The Custom Layers feature includes icons, shaded polygons, or both which are managed by admin users in the Control Center. Custom layers icons and areas can represent items such as flood zones, blocked roads, shelters, ice distribution trucks, or offices. Users of the map can turn the custom layers items on or off from the map legend card, and they can interact with custom layers items on the map to open an information panel with a name and a note. When custom layers items are visible on the map, the legend includes definitions for the custom layers icons and areas.\nMap Display Options The map display options are a collection of buttons at the upper left corner of the map, to the right of the overview panel or help panel when that panel is open.\nThe available buttons from top to bottom are:\nSearch Show My Location (requires the user to allow location services) Map Overview Select Language (if enabled, this allows users to change the map UI between the languages supported by the map) Visible map display options buttons for desktop and mobile browsers can be configured in the Instance Manager.\nNote\rTranslations for most map elements are managed in the Instance Manager. Storm Center supports English, French, and Spanish.\nSearch Button and Bookmarks Tool The search button opens a modal with a search box and a bookmarks tool for saving locations. The search box allows users to enter an address, city name, or ZIP code to navigate to a specific location on the map. The bookmarks tool allows users to name and save a location after they search for a location. Users must have local storage enabled on their web browsers to save locations as bookmarks.\nMap View supports a maximum of six bookmarks.\nAlert Banner The alert banner is an optional feature managed by admin users in the Control Center. When an alert banner is active, it appears at the top or bottom of the map with a title message. Users can interact with the banner to open a message card. The alert banner message can include lists, images, links, tables, and videos. The alert banner message can be set to open automatically on page load to make important messages more visible to users.\nMap Controls Zoom In and Zoom Out Storm Center supports zoom using a mouse wheel and pinch-to-zoom. The map also provides zoom in and zoom out buttons in the lower right corner of the map to support users who prefer manual selection or keyboard controls.\nThe zoom in and zoom out buttons are hidden by default when Storm Center detects a touch device such as a smartphone or a laptop touchpad that supports pinch-to-zoom. Visibility of the zoom buttons can be configured in the Instance Manager.\nBackground Map The background map is provided using the Google Maps API and includes up to three options: road, satellite, and hybrid. Users can change between the supported background map types using the controls in the lower right corner of the map.\nOutage Locations and Clusters In “View by Locations,” the map shows outage information using icons to represent individual outage locations and cluster icons to represent groups of outage locations that are close together.\nOutage location icons can be color-coded based on the number of customers affected by the outage, divided into one or more configurable ranges: for example, 1-10 customers, 11-50 customers, 51-250 customers, and more than 250 customers. Outage location icons use shapes as well as colors to distinguish between customers-affected ranges. An organization can alternatively choose to use one outage location icon color for all individual outage locations.\nOutage location icons can optionally include an additional icon that indicates when a repair crew is on site working to repair the outage.\nOutage cluster icons can optionally indicate how many outage locations are included in the cluster.\nInformation Panels When users interact with an outage location icon, an information panel opens from the right side of the map (for desktop browsers) or the bottom of the map (for mobile browsers).\nInformation panels for outage location icons can include any combination of the following data:\nEstimated restoration time (ERT) Number of customers affected Start time of the outage Incident ID Cause of outage Crew status Comments Metadata - additional configurable information types described in the outage file specification Information panels for outage cluster icons can include any combination of the following data:\nNumber of outages Earliest start time for outages in the cluster Latest estimated restoration time (ERT) for outages in the cluster Number of customers affected Information panels for outage cluster icons can expand at closer zoom levels, which shows information for the individual outage locations included in the cluster instead of aggregated information for all outages in the cluster.\nPlanned Outage Locations and Clusters (Optional) If a map includes information about planned outages, the planned outage view shows information using icons to represent individual planned outage locations and cluster icons to represent groups of planned outage locations that are close together.\nPlanned outage location icons can be color-coded based on the number of customers affected by the outage, divided into one or more configurable ranges: for example, 1-10 customers, 11-50 customers, 51-250 customers, and more than 250 customers. Planned outage location icons use shapes as well as colors to distinguish between customers-affected ranges. An organization can alternatively choose to use one planned outage location icon color for all individual planned outage locations.\nIf a planned outage view is configured to use one range for all planned outages, the map legend can show a label such as “Planned Outage” instead of a number range for number of customers affected.\nPlanned outage cluster icons can optionally indicate how many planned outage locations are included in the cluster.\nInformation Panels When users interact with a planned outage location icon, an information panel opens from the right side of the map (for desktop browsers) or the bottom of the map (for mobile browsers).\nInformation panels for planned outage location icons can include any combination of the following data:\nEstimated start time of the outage Estimated end time of the outage Estimated duration of the outage Number of customers affected Incident ID Cause of outage Comments Metadata - additional configurable information types described in the planned outage file specification Information panels for planned outage cluster icons can include any combination of the following data:\nNumber of outages Earliest start time for planned outages in the cluster Latest estimated end time for planned outages in the cluster Number of customers affected Information panels for planned outage cluster icons can expand at closer zoom levels, which shows information for the individual planned outage locations included in the cluster instead of aggregated information for all planned outages in the cluster.\nOutages by Area In “View by County,” “View by ZIP,” and “View by CTV,” the map shows outage information using colored shading to represent areas with outages. The shading can be color-coded based on the number or percentage of customers affected by outages in the area, divided into one or more configurable ranges. An organization can alternatively choose to use one color for shading all areas affected by outages.\nIn the data specifications, a group of areas of the same type is called a “thematic.” For example, the data that defines the shape of counties to be shown on a Storm Center map would be included in a thematic file.\nInformation Panels When users interact with a shaded area, an information panel opens from the right side of the map (for desktop browsers) or the bottom of the map (for mobile browsers).\nInformation panels for shaded areas can include any combination of the following data:\nNumber of outages Number of customers affected Number of customers served % of customers affected Earliest start time for outages in the area Latest estimated restoration time (ERT) for outages in the area Information Panel Link Buttons Information panels can also include one or more buttons at the bottom of the panel. In addition to the Magnify/Zoom button, which is mandatory, one or more link buttons can be configured in the Instance Manager with a label and link target.\nSeparate buttons can be configured for the information panels attached to outage locations, outage location clusters, and each type of area.\nInformation Panel Configurable Content Information panels can include a configurable content block at the bottom of the panel. Separate content can be configured for the information panels attached to outage locations, outage location clusters, and each type of area.\nAdditional Map Layers (optional) The Additional Map Layer module allows clients to display additional data like hazards, gas outages, flooding etc. on their public or internal Outage Maps, such as safety concerns, planned work, and reliability indexes. Clients collect and deliver the information in a GeoJSON file via the Additional Map Layer datafeed, and Storm Center presents the features on their maps with the client’s chosen symbology. The layer can be displayed on one or more Storm Center maps, and map users can view detailed information about a feature by selecting it.

    "content": "What is the Notifi Deregistration Manager? The Notifi Deregistration Manager is a microservice built to identify and deregister contacts in existing and future Notifi environments according to configurable rules. KUBRA created the Deregistration Manager to allow Notifi to manage large numbers of contacts while remaining compliant with recent FCC rulings on the TCPA and other regulations for sending automated messages to customers.\nTerms and Conditions - Managing Pending Contacts By default, Notifi uses a double-opt-in process for new SMS and email contacts: when a new contact is added to the Notifi system, Notifi sends a confirmation message to the customer which asks the customer to respond. The response is used to confirm that the contact is valid and has been added to the system correctly. If the customer does not respond to the confirmation message, the contact is considered “pending,” and Notifi will not send any further messages to the contact.\nTo clean up backlogs of pending contacts and manage additional pending contacts on an ongoing basis, KUBRA has included rules for managing pending contacts in the Deregistration Manager.\nFeature Overview To clean up the contact backlog, the Deregistration Manager first scans contacts in the data warehouse over a specified period of time and identifies pending contacts. The Deregistration Manager then creates an output file with the list of pending contacts as a report which KUBRA emails to the organization for review before the next step. After KUBRA receives approval from the organization, the Deregistration Manager submits a request to Notifi to deregister the pending contacts using the appropriate Profile API. Only this one-time cleanup of the contact backlog includes a review and approval process for deregistration.\nTo manage pending contacts on an ongoing basis, the Deregistration Manager scans contacts in the data warehouse over a specified period of time (daily by default) and creates a list of contacts added to the data warehouse at least one day before the start of the scan time that remain pending as of the scan time. The Deregistration Manager then submits a request to Notifi to re-send the confirmation message or send a follow-up message to the pending contacts.\nThe Deregistration Manager considers a contact to be pending and requests a follow-up message to the contact if one or more days have passed since the contact was added to the data warehouse. For example, if a scan runs on February 8, the Deregistration Manager will consider any contacts added on or before February 7 that have not responded to Terms and Conditions to be pending.\nWe have listed steps to show how Notifi handles pending registrations.\nStep 1: The pending registrant becomes eligible for a follow-up message.\nStep 2: They receive a follow-up message in 24 hours from when they become eligible.\nStep 3: The follow-up message will wait 2 days for a response.\nStep 4: If more than 2 days have passed after the follow-up message was sent, the Deregistration Manager will consider that message expired.\nStep 5: The registrant will then need to retry registering themselves.\nNote\rThe Deregistration Manager does not send follow-up messages to contacts which initiated registration via two-way SMS. Notifi treats contacts which do not accept Terms and Conditions in two-way SMS as if the user had rejected the Terms and Conditions.\nConfiguration Options To clean up a backlog of pending contacts, an organization can set an end date for the Deregistration Manager to use for the initial search. To manage pending contacts on an ongoing basis, the organization can create and select one or more message templates for re-sending a confirmation message.\nConfiguration Definition Default Value Options Initial Review Period The period of time for which contacts in the Notifi system will be reviewed to determine which contacts are pending and need to be deregistered from the system. The initial review includes all contacts registered on or before an end date. Yesterday The end date can be any value. DND Time A window during which Notifi will NOT send follow-up messages. 8:00 pm to 8:00 am This can be any time, must include a start time and end time, and is one setting for the entire implementation. Follow-Up Message Text The text of the message Notifi will use for confirmation follow-ups to pending contacts. - Text is needed for email and/or SMS text message templates. This can be the same text as the original confirmation message. Decide whether to include “Reply N to unsubscribe” language as part of the SMS follow-up template. TCPA Compliance - Managing Disconnected Phone Numbers The July 2015 FCC ruling on the TCPA includes a stringent set of rules around wrong numbers or reassigned numbers. Companies are only exempt from liability under the TCPA for one call to a mobile phone number that has been reassigned. The Notifi Preference Center tracks explicit registrations and subscriptions from customers, and Notifi message templates include opt-out options, which help reduce the risk of sending multiple messages to wrong or reassigned numbers. Because the entity sending messages is responsible for either obtaining permission from the new owner or removing the phone number from its list of contacts in cases where a phone number is reassigned, we also need a way to track and deregister these phone numbers.\nTo track phone numbers that become disconnected or change owners and deregister those phone numbers from Notifi, KUBRA has included rules for managing disconnected phone numbers in the Deregistration Manager.\nFeature Overview The Deregistration Manager performs a daily scan to identify contacts added since the time of the last scan. The Deregistration Manager then submits the list of new contacts to a monitoring service. There may be a delay of up to 24 hours between the time a contact is registered and the time the contact is added to the list of monitored contacts.\nThe monitoring service tracks disconnect data from cellular service providers and sends a file back to the Deregistration Manager with a list of contacts that have been disconnected. Currently, the monitoring service tracks data from AT\u0026T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, and US Cellular. The monitoring service will attempt to expand this list of carriers as data becomes available.\nThe Deregistration Manager matches the list of disconnected contacts to the appropriate Notifi implementation and submits a request to the Notifi implementation for those contacts to be deregistered using the appropriate Profile API. Notifi handles deregistrations requested by the Deactivation Manager in the same way as deregistrations requested by a customer.\nConfiguration Options There are no configurable features for the TCPA Compliance portion of the Deregistration Manager.\nPhone Number Lookup - Distinguishing Landline and Mobile Phone Numbers Organizations with phone numbers in an existing customer information system sometimes want to register those phone numbers in Notifi to receive automated alerts by IVR (voice) or SMS (text). Notifi requires a contact to be associated with a communication channel, and SMS messages can only be sent to mobile phone numbers. Organizations that do not know whether the numbers in their systems are landline or mobile need a way to determine this information before they can register contacts for SMS messages.\nThe Deregistration Manager includes a real-time web service option which organizations can use to determine whether provided phone numbers are landline or mobile. The real-time phone type identification service is a web service that accepts SOAP or REST requests which include phone number data. The service returns whether the phone number type is landline (L) or mobile (W for “wireless”). The organization can then use this information to call the Notifi Profile web service to register the contact for IVR messages, SMS messages, or both, as desired and applicable.\nConfiguration Options There are no configurable features for the real-time phone number lookup service.",

The Instance Manager interface allows authorized users to set up data files and feeds for Storm Center instances and to manage configurable features and maps related to an organization’s instances.\nData Files Region files - These files define the boundaries of an organization’s service territory or region on the map. If an organization has multiple regions in its service territory, the organization can provide one region file for each region and choose to show either multiple regions on one public-facing map or one region each on multiple public-facing maps. Thematic files - These files define the boundaries of geographical areas within a region, such as counties, postal codes, or cities, towns, and villages. Delivery node files - These files list the locations of delivery nodes in a region and the number of customers served by each delivery node. “Delivery node” refers to a location with a unique ID in the Outage Management System or other source of outage data. Outage files - These files list outages affecting delivery nodes in a region and provide information about each outage such as an estimated restoration time, cause, comments, and repair crew status. Planned outage files (optional, requires Planned Outages module) - These files list outages that are planned to take place at a specific point in time and provide information about each outage such as an estimated start and end time, number of customers affected, and comments. Additional map layer files (optional, requires Additional Map Layer module) - These files includes additional data like hazards, gas outages, flooding etc. that clients want to convey to their customers. See the Storm Center File Specifications for more information about the data files used by Storm Center.\nData File Upload Initial Region files and Thematic files must be uploaded directly using the Instance Manager interface. Updated Region files and Thematic files can be uploaded directly using the Instance Manager interface, or they can be delivered via HTTPS PUT requests.\nOutage files, Delivery Node files, Planned Outage files, and Additional Map Layer files must be delivered via HTTPS POST requests.\nThe POST requests require Basic Authentication. This is provided as the Authorization header value with the string value Basic followed by the base64-encoded username and password of a user that has access to upload files, in the format username:password. Each request must have the Content-Type multipart/form-data. Each file must be attached to the corresponding request as a form field of type file.\nKUBRA will provide the endpoints for data file delivery, as well as usernames and passwords for authentication to the endpoints, during the development phase of a Storm Center implementation project.\nInstance Manager Navigate to the Instance Manager website. Sign in using Google or other single sign-on credentials. Choose a tenant. This option is only presented if you have access to more than one tenant. Choose an application. This option is only presented if you have access to more than one application. In the Storm Center application, KUBRA recommends a default setup with three instances: Sandbox, Test, and Production. The Sandbox instance can be used to develop new maps with different data feeds or configurations than the Test and Production instances. The Test instance can be used for initial setup and for testing changes before applying them to Production. The Production instance can be the only instance with maps accessible to customers or other end-users.\nYou can create different maps for audiences such as customers, employees, and local stakeholders in each of your instances and manage settings for each map separately. For example, you can create an “external” map available to the public that includes the types of information customers are most likely to find helpful, as well as an “internal” map with access restricted to authorized employees that includes additional information such as outage ID numbers and internal comments.\nThe Instance Manager Storm Center application includes tools for\nCreating a new instance Editing instance settings Adding region files Adding thematic files Specifying a set of data sources for an instance - region, thematic, delivery node, outage data, and additional map layer data Configuring resources that can be shared by multiple maps Creating a map and setting map-specific configurations Deploying maps and managing deployed maps Managing admin features for deployed maps Managing access restriction policies The Instance Manager also includes a Data Feeds application for connecting file feeds for delivery node files, outage files, planned outage files, and additional map layer files to a Storm Center instance, and forms for creating user accounts and managing user accounts for Instance Manager.\nSee the Configuration Guide for more information on how to use the Instance Manager to set up and manage Storm Center instances and maps.",

To set up a Storm Center instance for an organization, you must provide:\nOne or more region files, uploaded at least once and updated whenever the boundaries of the organization’s region or regions change. One or more thematic files, uploaded at least once and updated whenever the boundaries of any of the thematic areas change. A delivery node file, uploaded periodically to keep up with changes to the number or location of the organization’s delivery nodes. KUBRA requires that an organization upload an updated delivery node file no more than once per day and at least once every 90 days. One suggested schedule is provide delivery node files weekly. An outage file, uploaded periodically to keep up with changes to outage information. KUBRA suggests that an organization upload an outage file every 15 minutes. The organization using Storm Center must provide thematic files for each type of thematic, such as County, ZIP Code, or City/Town/Village (CTV).\nStorm Center also supports two additional types of data file for use with the optional modules:\nPlanned outage files - These files list outages that have an estimated start and end time because they are planned in advance. They also provide information about each outage such as a duration, the number of customers affected, comments, and an area affected by the outage. Additional Map Layer files - These files contain geographical features and associated data provided by clients. The features are presented on Storm Center maps with the symbology chosen by the client at the configuration phase. For all data files, you must follow the KUBRA-provided data specifications. For example, all coordinate data must be provided according to EPSG:4326, also known as WGS84.\nProviding Data Files Region files and thematic files can be provided via a direct upload to the Instance Manager interface or via HTTPS PUT request. Organizations that do not have access to the Storm Center app in Instance Manager can provide these files to KUBRA, and KUBRA will upload the files during the development phase of a Storm Center implementation project. If the organization needs to periodically update region files, thematic files, or both, KUBRA can provide the endpoints for file delivery by the appropriate user or system.\nProviding Data Feeds Delivery node files, outage files, planned outage files, and additional map layer files must be delivered via HTTPS POST request. The POST requests require Basic Authentication. This is provided as the Authorization header value with the string value Basic followed by the base64-encoded username and password of a user that has access to upload files, in the format username:password. Each request must have the Content-Type multipart/form-data. Each file must be attached to the corresponding request as a form field of type file.\n(Optional) Override Spatial Scanning By default, delivery nodes are placed within a thematic area and within a region based on the latitude and longitude provided for the delivery node element in the delivery node data feed. This behavior can be overridden by using references to areaId and to regionCode within the delivery node file.\nTo override the automatic spatial scanning for delivery nodes, you must include a unique thematic area identifier, areaId, in the thematic file. You must also reference the areaId and areaType in the delivery node file within the areas element. areaType is a property defined when adding the thematic in the Instance Manager user interface. For example, “county” and “zip” are area types.\nIf your instance includes multiple regions, you can also include a unique region identifier, regionCode, in the delivery node file. regionCode is a property defined when adding a region in the Instance Manager user interface. By default, Storm Center uses the first two alphanumeric characters of the region name entered in Instance Manager as the regionCode value.\nIf your instance includes only one region and you have some delivery nodes with coordinates outside the boundaries of that region, you can use regionCode to override spatial scanning and identify those delivery nodes with the region specified by the regionCode.\nIf your instance includes only one region and all of your delivery node coordinates fall within the boundaries of that region, you can omit the regionCode and Storm Center will identify all delivery nodes with the single region for the instance using spatial scanning.\nNote\rValues for regionCode and areaType are case sensitive. All references to these elements in delivery node files must match the case used in region and thematic files and in the Instance Manager user interface.\nAssumptions KUBRA makes the following assumptions about data files used for Storm Center maps.\nGeometry boundaries in a region file do not overlap. If any of the provided geometry boundaries in a region file overlap, KUBRA will fail the entire region file. The organization providing thematic files has validated all thematic areas to be within or intersecting the region defined in the region file. KUBRA is not responsible for ensuring that areas provided in thematic files match the boundaries of a specific region. Thematic areas share borders but do not overlap. KUBRA will provide verification of thematic areas and fail the entire thematic file if it contains overlapping thematic areas. If thematic areas exist in a hierarchy (such as towns within counties), the organization providing thematic files will give KUBRA a description of this hierarchy to configure the Storm Center map appropriately. Delivery nodes are validated to be within the boundary formed by the region provided in the region file. They are also validated to be within a specific thematic area polygon or multi-polygon shape provided in the thematic files. Alternatively, the delivery node file can specify a region and one or more thematic areas for each delivery node. Details for this option are included in the region file, thematic file, and delivery node file specifications. Failures More information about data feed file processing failures.",
    "description": "Storm Center uses five mandatory types of data files:\nRegion files - These files define the boundaries of an organization’s service territory or region on the map. If an organization has multiple regions in its service territory, the organization can provide one region file for each region and choose whether to show multiple regions on one public-facing map or one region each on multiple public-facing maps. Thematic files - These files define the boundaries of areas within a region, such as counties, postal codes, or cities, towns, and villages.",

Instead, KUBRA uses a special configuration of the Excessive Messaging Protection feature to prevent multiple copies of a broadcast message from going to a single contact.\nConfiguration Options Message aggregation is limited either to event data sent in a single batch file, or to event data sent via web service that is labeled as a single batch.\nEach organization using Notifi can choose to use message aggregation either for all message types, or only for specified message types. For example, an organization can choose to use aggregation for outage and billing messages but not for energy usage messages. For each message type to be implemented, the organization must decide whether or not the message type will be eligible for aggregation.\nFor each message type that is chosen to be eligible for aggregation, the organization must make some decisions related to the message template designs for both individual messages and aggregated messages. Designs must be considered for each supported communication channel and each supported language. For example, if outage alerts will be eligible for aggregation and the implementation supports email and SMS text messages, the organization must review and approve designs for an individual email message, an aggregated email message, an individual text message, and an aggregated text message.\nOptions for aggregated message templates include\nlisting all affected accounts including language such as “Account XYZ and more” including language such as “affecting X accounts” In addition, the following variable must be defined:\nAggregated Messaging Candidacy Threshold - the number of accounts a contact must be associated with in the Notifi system for Notifi to attempt to aggregate eligible messages to that contact. Messages are aggregated only if they are part of a single data batch and have a message type that is configured to use message aggregation. Default Value - 3 accounts Options - there is not currently a limitation on this value (it can be any number of accounts)",

IncidentWatch uses the term “asset” to refer to items for which an Organization wants to accept incident reports. For example, these could be streetlights, area lights, traffic lights, signs, water pipes, meters, poles, transformers, bus stops, buildings, or roads.\nAsset files must be delivered via HTTPS POST requests to an endpoint specified by the Data Feeds application.\nGeographic Coordinate System The coordinates of each asset must be provided in EPSG:4326, also known as WGS84. There is currently no support for providing coordinates in other geographic projection systems.

An asset member MAY contain the following elements:\nElement Description metadata A configurable set of properties used to track information about an asset to be shown on the IncidentWatch map. The properties to be included in the metadata element are defined as part of an implementation project. servicedBy A string value indicating which organization services the asset.

Muted - The message was not delivered due to one of the situations described below, which will be shown under “Details” below each message: Muted - An administrator muted the message category using the Notifi Admin tool. Auto Paused - Excessive Messaging Protection was triggered. Paused - The contact owner requested that Notifi temporarily pause messages. Obsolete - The message was deferred due to a Do Not Disturb period (either set by the customer or from an implementation-level configuration) and Notifi has a more recent message about the same event that will be sent at the end of the Do Not Disturb period. Messages marked as Obsolete will not be sent. Expired - The message has been unable to be delivered within 48 hours. Messages marked as Expired will not be reattempted. Bad Contact - The contact not both Enabled and Valid. Contacts may be marked invalid if previous messages have resulted in a “Permanent Failure” status. Opted Out - The contact is on the Notifi opt-out list. Messages marked as Opted Out will not be sent to comply with the contact owner’s wishes, telcom guidelines, and federal spam messaging regulations. No Template - There may be a misconfiguration in Notifi and a valid template cannot be found for the notification’s event type. Contact KUBRA support if this occurs. Errors in Template - The template rendering service has errors. This may be due to either unexpected data in the event or an error in template design by KUBRA or any users with access to Template Manager. Contact KUBRA support for assistance. No Studio Flow - There is a misconfiguration in the voice notification flow. Contact KUBRA support if this occurs. Unexpected Failure - There was an uncaught exception within Notifi. Contact KUBRA support for assistance. Permanent Failure - The message was not delivered and should not be retried. This can be caused by a spam report from the recipient, a hard bounce, or because the recipient unsubscribed. Permanent Success - The message was delivered and/or opened. Temporary Failure - The message was not delivered, but future messages to the contact may succeed. This can be caused by a full email inbox, for example. Temporary Success - The message provider sent the message, but it has not yet been received. In addition, the message history tool may show details sent by the message provider.

Region files can be provided via direct upload to the Instance Manager or via HTTPS PUT request to an endpoint specified by the Instance Manager application.\nAttachments\rAZ-example-regions.json\r(0 kb)\rAssumptions Geometry boundaries within a region file will not overlap. If any of the provided geometry boundaries within a region file overlap, KUBRA will fail the entire region file.\nAll thematic areas provided in thematic files will be validated to be within or intersecting the region.\nGeographic Coordinate System The coordinates of each region must be provided in EPSG:4326, also known as WGS84. There is currently no support for providing coordinates in other geographic projection systems. For details about the EPSG:4326 coordinate system, access the specification provided by Spatial Reference External link opens in new tab\r.\nFile Structure Region files are defined in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format as specified in Internet Engineering Task Force standard RFC7159 External link opens in new tab\r. A JSON object MUST be at the root of the region file.\nGeoJSON Specification Region files must adhere to the GeoJSON format specifications published by geojson.org at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946 External link opens in new tab\r. The file should contain a single FeatureCollection. In this collection of features, only Polygon and MultiPolygon geometry types will be consumed. Multiple features can exist in this feature collection.\nValues for geometry type are case-sensitive.\nNote\rThe Storm Center region file does not use any values for the properties element, but this element is required as part of the GeoJSON specification.\nExample 1 - A region file {\r\"type\":\"FeatureCollection\",\r\"features\":[\r{\r\"type\":\"Feature\",\r\"geometry\":{\r\"type\":\"MultiPolygon\",\r\"coordinates\":[[\r[\r[-111.49,34.50],\r[-114.91,34.50],\r[-114.91,31.28],\r[-111.49,31.28],\r[-111.49,34.50]\r]\r]]\r},\r\"properties\": {}\r}\r]\r}\rAlternate Format - Using Region Codes If an organization has more than one region, or if an organization has one region and some delivery nodes with coordinates outside the boundaries of that region, you can include a region code for each region in the Instance Manager user interface and reference these region codes in the delivery node file. Region codes are case sensitive and can be up to four alphanumeric characters. By default, Storm Center will use the first two alphanumeric characters of the region name as the region code.\nStorm Center uses region codes to override spatial scanning for identifying which delivery nodes belong to a region. If a region code is not provided for a delivery node, Storm Center will use spatial scanning to determine which region the delivery node is located in.\nPolygon This section describes considerations and requirements for the Polygon geometry type. These considerations and requirements also apply to each individual polygon within the MultiPolygon geometry type.\nPolygon coordinates are an array of linear ring coordinate arrays. The first linear ring must be the exterior ring of the polygon, followed by any interior linear rings.\nA linear ring provided for a polygon must follow the right-hand rule with respect to the area it bounds per section 3.1.6 of the GeoJSON specification.\nSelf-Intersecting Polygons with self-intersecting shapes are considered invalid. KUBRA will not be responsible for identifying these polygons and filtering them out.\nNon-Closing The polygon shape must start and stop at the same point to be considered a “closed” polygon. KUBRA will identify non-closing polygons and fail the upload process if there are non-closing polygons in the region file.\nGIS Generalizer KUBRA highly recommends that you use a generalizer tool on GIS data to simplify the edges of the polygons before you include them in a region file. Reducing the number of coordinates helps increase the outage map performance and improve the processing time of delivery node and outage files.\nAs a starting point for the generalization, KUBRA recommends a Douglas algorithm with a tolerance ratio of 0.0005 for data in EPSG:4326 with the “Preserve shared boundaries” option selected. The “Preserve shared boundaries” option helps avoid overlapping areas or missing space between adjacent areas. You will likely need to adjust the tolerance for the data generalization depending on the detail of your GIS data and the desired result.\nFailure Scenarios KUBRA will consider the region file upload as a failure if any of the following scenarios apply:\nThe region file has zero elements of type FeatureCollection or has a FeatureCollection with an empty Features array. The region file has one or more polygons found to be “non-closing.” The region file has one or more Feature objects missing the geometry element. The region file has one or more Feature objects where the type element within the geometry element is anything other than Polygon or MultiPolygon.",

    "content": "Types of Releases KUBRA makes four types of releases for the multi-tenant products documented on this website.\nMaintenance Releases Maintenance Downtime Releases Feature Releases Preview Releases Maintenance Releases do not include any changes to features or configuration items. They may include security updates, bug fixes, or internal product changes that are only visible to KUBRA.\nMaintenance Downtime Releases are similar to Maintenance Releases, except that they may cause a period of downtime. KUBRA will provide email announcements before a Maintenance Downtime Release to organizations that may be affected by the downtime.\nFeature Releases are used when a release includes new features or feature changes that are fully compatible with existing instances. Changes to administrative user interfaces are also considered Feature Releases. KUBRA will provide an email announcement about new features or feature changes included in a Feature Release when the feature is available to all production instances.\nPreview Releases are used when a release includes new features or feature changes that impact the map layout or the customer experience. Preview Releases may also include new features or feature changes that require activation for an instance.\nKUBRA will provide an email announcement two weeks before a Preview Release. Changes included in a Preview Release are released in a two-to-four-week preview period to non-critical instances before they are released to critical instances.\nThe preview period is intended to allow organizations to\npreview any changes to the user interface let the KUBRA team know about any observed bugs plan for configuration updates as desired update help documents, videos, images on the organization’s website, etc. Pre-Release Testing Before all releases, KUBRA completes automated and manual regression testing to confirm that updates included in the release will not have an unintended impact on user interfaces and instances in production.\nFor Feature Releases and Preview Releases, KUBRA also completes manual testing of new configuration options or features.\nCommunication about Maintenance Downtime Releases KUBRA will provide an email announcement one week before the Maintenance Downtime Release and a second email announcement 60 minutes before the Maintenance Downtime Release. These announcements will include a description of the maintenance, its impact, and the duration of the expected downtime. Organizations are not expected to take any action in response to these announcements.\nCommunication about Feature Releases KUBRA will provide an email announcement about new features or feature changes included in a Feature Release when the feature is available. Features and feature changes included in a Feature Release will not automatically change production instances. The new features or settings must be enabled or changed through configuration before they will be visible to users.\nCommunication about Preview Releases KUBRA will provide an email announcement about new features or feature changes to be included in a Preview Release two weeks before the Preview Release is made to non-critical instances. The preview will be available for two to four weeks, after which the feature changes in the Preview Release will be released to all instances, including critical instances.\nWhen a preview is available, users with access to admin user interfaces will see a note on the instance dashboard for all non-critical instances. When a user accesses a user interface associated with a non-critical instance, a pop-up will indicate that a preview is available and allow the user to either view the user interface with the feature changes applied or view the user interface in its previous version, without feature changes.\nCritical Instances vs. Non-Critical Instances Each tenant account can have multiple product instances, which behave similarly to environments in a single-tenant application. For example, a tenant can include a Development instance, a Test instance, and a Production instance. Each tenant account can have one “critical” instance, which is typically the instance used for production user interfaces.\nNew feature previews are not displayed on a critical instance. This allows each organization to view the new features on a non-critical instance (such as a Test environment), make any desired configuration adjustments, and provide feedback to KUBRA before the new features are released for critical instances as well.\nKUBRA may delay the release of a preview to critical instances if bugs are reported that need to be fixed. Other comments users provide to KUBRA during the preview period will be considered for future releases.",
    "description": "Types of Releases KUBRA makes four types of releases for the multi-tenant products documented on this website.\nMaintenance Releases Maintenance Downtime Releases Feature Releases Preview Releases Maintenance Releases do not include any changes to features or configuration items. They may include security updates, bug fixes, or internal product changes that are only visible to KUBRA.\nMaintenance Downtime Releases are similar to Maintenance Releases, except that they may cause a period of downtime.",

    "content": "Feature Information Notifi provides excessive messaging protection to improve the customer experience by providing messaging caps in situations where too many messages are being sent to a customer.\nIf a customer contact (such as a phone number or email address) has been receiving a large number of messages, Notifi can be set to pause delivery of any further SMS or email messages for a set period of time to limit the total number of messages sent to a single contact. By default, Notifi considers more than 10 messages in 1 hour to be a large number of messages and stops delivery of further messages to the contact for 2 hours.\nEmail and SMS Text Message Behavior For email and SMS text messages, after the threshold is passed, Notifi sends a message to the contact indicating that the contact has been paused. SMS users can reply RESUME to continue receiving messages. Email users can click a link in the pause notification to continue receiving messages.\nVoice Message Behavior For voice messages, after the threshold is passed, each additional voice message includes an option for the customer to pause delivery of further messages (for example, “press 3 to temporarily stop receiving calls from ABC Company”).\nBroadcast Message Behavior For messages sent using the Notifi Broadcast tool, there is a configuration that stops additional messages to a specific contact after 1 message from a broadcast batch. All auto-pauses created for the broadcast batch are removed when the batch is completed.\nHistory and Reports Behavior Messages that would have been sent to a contact during the pause period are not queued or re-delivered, but they are marked in the History tool and the Reports tool with a delivery status of “Auto Paused.”\nConfiguration Options To set up excessive messaging protection, an organization using Notifi must establish a list of message types to be considered for excessive messaging. This list can be either inclusive (listing messages to be considered) or exclusive (listing messages not to be considered). For example, outage messages can be configured so that they are excluded from excessive messaging protection.\nIf a message type is excluded from excessive messaging protection, messages of that type will not be counted toward the Excessive Messaging Threshold. However, when the Excessive Messaging Threshold is reached, all messages to the contact will be paused.\nIf a customer requests a pause for a contact, all proactive messages will be paused for the User Pause Duration or until the customer requests to resume receiving messages (whichever is sooner), regardless of any other excessive messaging configurations.\nThe following variables must be defined:\nExcessive Messaging Duration - the period of time to be reviewed to determine if the number of messages sent to a contact is excessive. Default Value - 1 hour Options - any number of hours between 1 hour and 24 hours Excessive Messaging Threshold - the number of messages a contact must receive within the Excessive Messaging Duration to be considered to be receiving excessive messages. All messages with message types that are configured to be considered for excessive messaging are counted when determining whether a contact has received excessive messages. After the Excessive Messaging Threshold is reached, Notifi will take action according to the contact channel. The same action will be applied to all messages, including messages with message types that are not counted toward the Excessive Messaging Threshold. Default Value - 10 messages Options - there is not currently a limitation on this value (it can be any number of messages) System Pause Duration - the amount of time after the system generates a pause for excessive messaging that the pause expires (automatically resuming messaging). Default Value - 2 hours Options - there is not currently a limitation on this value - it can be a number of hours, or a set time such as “Next Day at 6:00 a.m.” However, this setting must be equal to or longer than the Excessive Messaging Duration. For example, if the Excessive Messaging Duration is set to 1 hour, the System Pause Duration must be at least 1 hour. As another example, if the System Pause Duration is set to “Next Day at 8:00 a.m.,” the Excessive Messaging Duration must not be more than 8 hours. User Pause Duration - the amount of time after a user submits a PAUSE command that the pause expires (automatically resuming messaging). Default Value - 24 hours Options - there is not currently a limitation on this value (can be a number of hours or a set time, for example, the following day at 6:00 a.m.) Things to Consider to Configure Excessive Messaging Protection The values for Excessive Messaging Duration, Excessive Messaging Threshold, and System Pause Duration need to be decided together, as they are used in combination to determine when and for how long to pause message delivery to a contact.\nFor example, you could choose to set the Excessive Messaging Duration to 3 hours, the Excessive Messaging Threshold to 10 messages, and the System Pause Duration to 4 hours. These choices would cause the Notifi system to pause message delivery to any contact that has received at least 10 messages in the past 3 hours, and then resume sending messages after the contact has been paused for 4 hours.\nSetting a lower Excessive Messaging Duration, a lower Excessive Messaging Threshold, or both will cause more contacts to be paused more frequently, and setting a longer System Pause Duration will cause more messages to be held from delivery to contacts that are paused. The business decision to be made is based on the value of reducing message frequency versus the value of information in those messages.\nUser Pause Duration sets an upper limit on the duration of a pause requested by a customer. This feature is available to prevent a situation where a customer who texts the command PAUSE to temporarily stop receiving messages forgets to text the command RESUME to resume receiving messages. The business decision to be made is based on the desired time for a contact to be paused or kept from receiving alerts.",

The icon will change to show the word Add when you hold your mouse cursor over it.\nYou can also click the drop-down to the right of the contact information at the top of the screen and select Add a new contact to open the Add a Contact form.\nIn the Add a Contact form, you may be able to use information on file for a new contact. Click the drop-down next to the Select a contact field to see a list of contacts on file for the account. Select the contact you want and then enter a Contact Name.\nTo create a new contact:\nSelect the Contact Method you want from the options below the Add a New Contact text - Email, Text, or Voice. Enter the email address or phone number. You may need to enter the contact information twice. This helps to prevent typing errors. Enter a Contact Name. (Optional) Choose Do Not Disturb settings. (Optional) Choose a language to use for messages to the contact. Review and accept the Terms of Use. Click the Submit button. Voice and Text Contacts You can use the same mobile phone number for both Voice and Text messages, but Notifi treats these as two separate contacts, one contact for each contact method.\nThis allows a phone number owner to receive bill reminders as voice messages and outage alerts as text messages, for example.\nDo Not Disturb Settings If there is a regular period of time during which the contact owner does not want to receive alerts, such as while they are asleep, you can set a do not disturb period for the contact.\nTo set a Do Not Disturb period:\nClick the Start field. Use the arrows to select a start time. Click the Done button. Click the End field. Use the arrows to select an end time. Click the Done button. If you do not select a start time and an end time for a Do Not Disturb period, messages may be sent to the contact at any time of day.\nIf the contact owner wants to receive messages related to electrical outages even during the Do Not Disturb period, click the checkbox next to the message “Disregard DO NOT DISTURB preference for OUTAGE notifications and alerts.”\nLanguage Settings If the Notifi implementation supports more than one language, you can choose which language to use for messages to each contact.\nTo choose a language, click the radio button next to the name of the language.\nTerms of Use You must click the checkbox next to the sentence “I have read and agree to the terms of use.” to accept the Terms of Use for the Notifi messaging system and save a new contact. Click on the terms of use text to open a pop-up window or a new browser tab with the Terms of Use document.\nConfirmation Messages When you enter and save a Text or Email contact for the first time, the Notifi messaging system may send a Confirmation Message to the contact. The owner of the contact must respond to the Confirmation Message before the messaging system will send messages to that contact.\nIf an account has one or more contacts that have not been verified using a Confirmation Message, you will see a note at the top of the preference center indicating that the contact is unverified. If you need to re-send a Confirmation Message, click the Resend message text in the note.\nEdit a Contact To edit information for an existing contact, click the Edit button (gear icon) to the left of the contact information at the top of the screen.\nIn the Edit Contact form, you can change the Contact Name, the Do Not Disturb settings, or the Language Settings for the contact.\nTo save your changes, click the Submit button.\nRe-Confirm a Contact If a message to a contact experiences a hard bounce, Notifi sets the contact back to an unverified state. In the Preferences UI, this looks the same as a contact that has been added for the first time and has not yet been verified. An unverified contact will not receive any messages from Notifi.\nIn this example, the red dot next to the text message icon for Mobile2 indicates that contact Mobile2 is unverified.\nTo re-verify a contact and allow it to start receiving messages again, select the contact from the contacts drop-down list and then click the Resend message text in the banner to send a new confirmation message.\nWhen the contact owner responds to the confirmation message, the contact will be re-verified and will be able to receive messages according to its preference settings.\nDelete a Contact To delete a contact:\nClick the Edit button (gear icon) to the left of the contact information at the top of the preference center screen. In the Edit Contact form, click the Delete Contact button. Click OK to confirm the delete action.

    "content": "Introduction This document outlines the data structure of a thematic file, which the Storm Center map uses to create thematic map overlays. The combination of boundary and metadata for each provided shape is called a thematic area. A collection of thematic areas in a thematic file is called a thematic.\nThe organization using Storm Center must provide thematic files for each type of thematic, such as County, ZIP Code, or City/Town/Village (CTV).\nThematic files can be provided via direct upload to the Instance Manager or via HTTPS PUT request to an endpoint specified by the Instance Manager application.\nAttachments\rUS-census-AZ-ZIP.json\r(41 kb)\rUS-census-AZ-county.json\r(290 kb)\rUS-census-AZ-county_areaIds.json\r(290 kb)\rAssumptions Delivery Nodes will be validated to be both within the calculated boundary formed by the region provided in the region file and within a specific thematic area polygon or multi-polygon shape provided in the thematic file or files chosen to filter delivery nodes.\nIf a region code, an area code, or both are provided for a delivery node, those values will be used instead of spatial scanning to validate the delivery node.\nKUBRA will not be responsible for ensuring continuity of a thematic file against a specific region.\nThematic areas will share borders but never overlap one another. KUBRA will provide verification of overlapping thematic areas and fail the entire thematic file if this constraint is violated.\nGeographic Coordinate System The coordinates of each thematic area must be provided in EPSG:4326, also known as WGS84. There is currently no support for providing coordinates in other geographic projection systems. For details about the EPSG:4326 coordinate system, access the specification provided by Spatial Reference External link opens in new tab\r.\nFile Structure Thematic files are defined in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format as specified in Internet Engineering Task Force standard RFC7159 External link opens in new tab\r. A JSON object MUST be at the root of the thematic file.\nGeoJSON Specification Thematic files must adhere to the GeoJSON format specifications published by geojson.org at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946 External link opens in new tab\r. The file should contain a single FeatureCollection. In this collection of features, only Polygon and MultiPolygon geometry types will be consumed. All other features will be ignored. Each feature is required to have a properties element. In the properties element, there must be at minimum a name element.\nValues for geometry type are case-sensitive.\nExample 1 - A thematic file { \"type\":\"FeatureCollection\", \"features\":[ { \"type\":\"Feature\", \"properties\":{ \"name\":\"Mohave\" }, \"geometry\":{ \"type\":\"MultiPolygon\", \"coordinates\":[[ [ [-111.49,34.50], [-114.91,34.50], [-114.91,31.28], [-111.49,31.28], [-111.49,34.50] ] ]] } } ] }\rHierarchy hierarchy is an optional element to allow nested tree structures within outage summary reports linked to the Storm Center outage map.\nYou can choose to define a thematic hierarchy. If you do, you will need to provide information about this hierarchy to KUBRA. If a hierarchy configuration exists for the Storm Center map, each thematic area is expected to have each of the specified hierarchy elements. These hierarchy elements do not have any ordering requirements.\nHere is an example of a hierarchy configuration in which one hierarchy is specified for a thematic of type “County.”\n{ \"properties\":{ \"name\":\"Westchester\", \"hierarchy\":{ \"state\":\"New York\" } } }\rHere is an example of a hierarchy configuration in which two hierarchies are specified for a thematic of type “CTV.” The hierarchies for each thematic area are not required to be in a specific order.\n{ \"properties\":{ \"name\":\"Tigard\", \"hierarchy\":{ \"state\":\"Oregon\", \"county\":\"Washington\" } } }\rAlternate Format - Using Area IDs and Area Type If you want to override spatial scanning for identifying which delivery nodes belong to a thematic area, you can include an areaId within the properties element for each feature in the thematic file and reference these area IDs in the delivery node file.\nNote\rThe areaId must be unique across the thematic file. The areaId value can be the same as the value for the name field, as long as the name is unique across the thematic file.\nYou must also reference the areaType in the delivery node file. The areaType is determined when you create a new thematic in the Instance Manager interface. The areaType is either the value selected from the “Select Area Type” drop-down list, or the value you enter for a custom area type.\nNote\rThe areaType value is case-sensitive and must be all lowercase for the default values: “county,” “zip,” or “ctv.” areaType values must be 15 characters or less.\nExample 2 - A thematic file with area IDs { \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\", \"features\": [ { \"type\": \"Feature\", \"properties\": { \"areaId\": \"AREA01\", \"hierarchy\": { \"state\": \"Arizona\" }, \"name\": \"Mohave\" }, \"geometry\": { \"type\": \"MultiPolygon\", \"coordinates\": [[ [ [-111.49,34.50], [-114.91,34.50], [-114.91,31.28], [-111.49,31.28], [-111.49,34.50] ] ]] } } ] }\rPolygon This section describes considerations and requirements for the Polygon geometry type. These considerations and requirements also apply to each individual polygon within the MultiPolygon geometry type.\nPolygon coordinates are an array of linear ring coordinate arrays. The first linear ring must be the exterior ring of the polygon, followed by any interior linear rings.\nA linear ring provided for a polygon must follow the right-hand rule with respect to the area it bounds per section 3.1.6 of the GeoJSON specification.\nSelf-Intersecting Polygons with self-intersecting shapes are considered invalid. KUBRA will not be responsible for identifying these polygons and filtering them out.\nNon-Closing The polygon shape must start and stop at the same point to be considered a “closed” polygon. KUBRA will identify non-closing polygons and fail the upload process if there are non-closing polygons in the thematic file.\nGIS Generalizer KUBRA highly recommends that you use a generalizer tool on GIS data to simplify the edges of the polygons before you include them in a thematic file. Reducing the number of coordinates helps increase the outage map performance and improve the processing time of delivery node and outage files.\nAs a starting point for the generalization, KUBRA recommends a Douglas algorithm with a tolerance ratio of 0.0005 for data in EPSG:4326 with the “Preserve shared boundaries” option selected. The “Preserve shared boundaries” option helps avoid overlapping areas or missing space between adjacent areas. You will likely need to adjust the tolerance for the data generalization depending on the detail of your GIS data and the desired result.\nFailure Scenarios KUBRA will consider the thematic file upload as a failure if any of the following scenarios apply:\nThe thematic file has zero elements of type FeatureCollection or has a FeatureCollection with an empty Features array. The thematic file has one or more polygons found to be “non-closing.” The thematic file has one or more thematic areas found to be overlapping one another. If hierarchies are configured and the thematic file has one or more Features missing one or more of the configured hierarchies. The thematic file has one or more Feature objects missing the properties element or the name element within properties. The thematic file has one or more Feature objects missing the geometry element. The thematic file has one or more Feature objects where the type element within the geometry element is anything other than Polygon or MultiPolygon.",

You can send a broadcast message to\nall registered customer contacts in the Notifi system a specific category of customer contacts in the Notifi system registered customer contacts associated with a list of customer account numbers you provide in a CSV file customer contacts included with a list of account numbers in a CSV file you provide Before you try to broadcast your message, refer to the PreBroadcast Checklist to check if you have completed all the steps.\nInitial View When you first open the Broadcast tool, you will see a list of messages that are being composed and have not been sent or scheduled, messages that are pending delivery, and messages that are in the process of being sent.\nMessage Status You can filter the list of broadcast messages by status. Notifi uses these broadcast message statuses:\nComposing - the message is being composed and has not been sent or scheduled (it is a draft) Pending - the message is awaiting delivery Running - the message is being delivered Completed - the message has been sent to all selected contacts Cancelled - the message was cancelled after being composed or scheduled Aborted - the message was stopped partway through delivery Failed - the message was not successfully sent Create a Broadcast Message To create a broadcast message:\nClick the plus sign icon at the upper right of the message list - the icon will change to show the word “New” when you hold your mouse cursor over it. Enter a name for the broadcast message. Enter content for the message for all channels and languages you want to include. Select criteria to identify message recipients. (Optional) Upload a CSV file to identify a list of account numbers to receive the broadcast message. (Optional) Send a test message to one or more provided contacts to check that the message appears or sounds correct. Send the message immediately or schedule the message to be sent at a later date and time. Name a Message By default, the name of a new broadcast message is “New Broadcast” followed by the current date and time. For example: “New Broadcast - Jan 2, 2020 4:45 PM.”\nTo change the name of the message, click the message name or the Edit button (pencil icon) that appears when you hold the mouse cursor over the message name.\nThe broadcast message name is for your reference inside the Broadcast tool. It will not appear anywhere in the messages sent to customer contacts.\nEnter Template Content The Templates section of the create message form shows the message templates for each available channel. If your Notifi implementation supports multiple languages, each available channel will also have a separate template for each supported language.\nAt a maximum, Notifi supports broadcast message templates for voice, email, SMS text, and push notification channels.\nTo create or edit a broadcast message template:\nSelect the channel. (Optional) Select the language. Enter text for the message template. Repeat steps 1-3 for each channel and language you want to include in the broadcast message. Click the Next button to continue to the Criteria section of the form. Note\rThe Broadcast tool does not provide any checks on the text you enter in the template fields. Please check the spelling, grammar, and message tone carefully. You may want to ask another person to check your work before you send the broadcast.\nIf you do not create a template for a channel, contacts for that channel will not receive the broadcast message. For example, if you only create an email template, the broadcast message will only be sent to email addresses.\nIf you do not create a template for a language, contacts with that language selected as a preference will not receive the broadcast message. For example, if English and Spanish are supported and you only create English templates, only contacts with a preference for English will receive the broadcast message.\nEmail Templates The text you enter in the Subject field will be the subject line of the email message. The text you enter in the Body field will be the body or main content of the email message.\nNotifi does not add any formatting around the content in the Body field, so you must include any HTML formatting you want to appear in the email messages sent to customers.\nIf you have an HTML email template created in another program, such as an email marketing program or a design program, you can use that HTML for the email template body.\nTo include HTML formatting in a broadcast email template:\nClick the Edit HTML button (pencil icon). Copy the HTML from your other program. Paste the HTML into the Broadcast tool. Click the Edit HTML button again to preview the HTML content in rich text view. Push Notification Templates The text you enter in the Alert Title field will be the title of the push notification. The text you enter in the other field will be the body or detailed content of the push notification.\nPush notifications are only supported for Android and iOS mobile apps. This option will not appear if neither Android nor iOS applications are integrated with your Notifi implementation.\niOS push notifications support a maximum of 65 characters for the alert title and 240 characters for the body of the message. Android push notifications support a maximum of 200 characters for the alert title and 1024 characters for the body of the message. Because the same broadcast message template is used for both iOS and Android, we recommend using the smaller character lengths.\nSMS Text Templates SMS text templates support a maximum of 140 bytes (or 160 characters, see below) in the U.S. for English-language messages. With Notifi 3.2 \u0026 4.0, the Broadcast tool works on the backend to stitch together multiple segments into one message a customer sees, allowing you to go over 160 characters. However, mobile carriers will still send such a longer message via multiple separate SMS messages/segments.\nThe counter at the lower right side of the template field tracks the number of characters you have entered. A red counter serves as an alert indicating that your template exceeds the character limit, causing the message to be sent in more than one SMS segment, each limited to 140 bytes. The number of bytes you use depends both on the number of characters (1 character = 7/8 byte when using ONLY GSM-7 characters) and the type of characters you use. If you use non-GSM-7 characters such as common non-English characters á, Á, í, Í, ó, Ó, ú, or Ú, the mobile carriers need to use the larger UCS-2 character set, which uses 16 rather than 7 bits per character, allowing for less characters per segment. KUBRA recommends you keep segment count lower and thus your costs down. You can do this by substituting non-accented characters where reasonable, as we do when working on non-broadcast templates with clients i.e. use a, A, i, I, o, O, u, or U if customers can infer the word you are spelling without the accent marks.\nNote\rThe Broadcast tool is set up with a default limitation of 480 characters or three message segments but additional segments can be added up to a limit of 1600 for an extra cost. Talk to your CSM if you want to extend your limits.\nTo minimize cost to both sender and recipient, the following special characters will be replaced automatically when entered into a SMS broadcast template upon save or when sending the broadcast:\nClick here to expand list of replaced characters for SMS\rUnicode Character Glyph Changed to U+0009 “ ” (five spaces) U+00AB « « U+00BB » » U+2002 \" \" (single space) U+2003 \" \" (single space) U+2004 \" \" (single space) U+2005 \" \" (single space) U+2006 \" \" (single space) U+2007 \" \" (single space) U+2008 \" \" (single space) U+2009 \" \" (single space) U+200A \" \" (single space) U+200B ​ \" \" (single space) U+200C ‌ \" \" (single space) U+200D ‍ \" \" (single space) U+200E ‎ \" \" (single space) U+200F ‏ \" \" (single space) U+2010 ‐ - (dash) U+2011 ‑ - (dash) U+2012 ‒ - (dash) U+2013 – - (dash) U+2014 — - (dash) U+2015 ― - (dash) U+2016 ‖ | (vertical line) U+2017 ‗ _ U+2018 ‘ ' U+2019 ’ ' U+201A ‚ , U+201B ‛ ' U+201C “ \" U+201D ” \" U+201E „ ,, U+2022 • * U+2023 ‣ * U+2026 … … U+2032 ′ ' U+2033 ″ '' U+2034 ‴ ’'' U+2035 ‵ ' U+2036 ‶ '' U+2037 ‷ ’'' U+2039 ‹ \u003c U+203a › \u003e U+203c ‼ !! U+203d ‽ ? U+2043 ⁃ * U+204e ⁎ * Voice Templates Voice templates for broadcast messages use text-to-speech to convert the text you type in the Body field into spoken voice messages.\nTo have numbers or letters read separately, as for a phone number or address, add space characters between the number or letter characters. For example, this can help make sure a phone number is read as five nine eight two instead of five thousand nine hundred eighty two. You can also use space characters to indicate pauses in the message.\nA more specific example of recommended formatting for a phone number is 2 1 0 ... 3 5 3 ... 4 3 5 7, which would be read with an additional pause between the area code and the first three digits of the phone number and between the first three digits and the last four digits of the phone number.\nSelect Recipients The Criteria section of the create message form allows you to do the following:\nSelect Criteria manually to filter who receives messages. OR Designate a CSV file you upload to filter who receives the messages. OR Designate a CSV file + subscriptions to filter who receives the messages. Warning\rIf you choose to designate a CSV file, you cannot choose any other criteria except subscriptions.\nOnce the intended recipients are defined, there is an option to add a list of subscriptions to filter those recipients against (see next section).\nYou can choose recipients for the message using the following address criteria types:\nCompanies - if your organization has only one operating company, you can select the operating company to select all account numbers with contacts registered in the Notifi database States Counties ZIP Codes To add recipient criteria:\nMove the mouse cursor over the Add Criteria text to show the list of criteria types. Click on a criteria type. Select the values for that criteria type you want to use to identify message recipients. Click the X icon at the upper right corner of the pop-up window to close it. Your selected criteria will appear in a list below the Add Criteria text. Repeat steps 1-4 for all criteria types you want to include. If you select multiple options within one type of recipient criteria, the options will act as ALL/ANY/OR selections. If you select multiple types of recipient criteria, the selections will act as AND selections.\nFor example, if you select five ZIP Codes, the broadcast message will be sent to contacts in the Notifi database registered to account numbers associated with ANY of the selected ZIP Codes.\nIf you select two ZIP Codes and a County, the broadcast message will be sent to contacts in the Notifi database registered to account numbers associated with ANY of the selected ZIP Code AND the selected County.\nUpload a CSV File In addition to or as an alternative to the criteria types shown in the broadcast tool, you can upload a CSV file with a list of account numbers to identify recipients for the broadcast message. The CSV file can also include contact information.\nTo upload a CSV file:\nClick the Upload button in the Criteria section of the create message form. Drag and drop the CSV file onto the pop-up window or click the Select File button and then locate the file on your computer. Click the X icon in the upper right corner of the pop-up window or “Close” once the progress bar says “file uploaded successfully”. Note\rThe file you upload will be verified when it is uploaded to ensure it conforms to the file format information below. Verification may take several more minutes after the upload dialog is closed to finish saving the file, particularly if it is 100,000+ lines long. If you attempt to send the broadcast immediately (rather than a scheduled broadcast) before the file save process is complete, you may be forced to wait to start the broadcast until the file save process is fully complete in the background.\nCSV File Format The CSV file name has a length limit of 50 characters. The CSV file has a maximum size limit of 150 MB.\nA header row is required for CSV files to indicate which attributes the file includes and the order of the attributes.\nAttribute Required? Description account Yes An account number - the Broadcast message will be sent to all contacts in the Notifi database registered to this account number, unless restricted by other selected criteria. contact No A phone number or email address you want to include as a contact for the account in addition to or in place of any contacts in the Notifi database registered to the account number. Phone numbers must be 11 digits (with leading country code and area code). Phone numbers must not contain any special characters. channel No if contact not provided; yes if contact provided The channel for the provided contact: one of SMS, IVR, or E_MAIL. supplemental No if contact not provided or if using ignoreSubscribedContacts; yes if contact provided and not using ignoreSubscribedContacts Boolean - this tells Notifi whether to treat the provided contact as a Supplemental Contact or a Default Contact. If true, Notifi will treat the contact as a Supplemental Contact. If false, Notifi will treat the contact as a Default Contact. If you include a contact but do not specify a value for this attribute, Notifi will treat the contact as a Default Contact. ignoreSubscribedContacts No if contact not provided; yes if contact provided and not using supplemental Boolean - this tells Notifi whether to ignore any contacts in the Notifi database registered to the account number when sending a message to the contact supplied in the CSV file. If true, Notifi will only send the broadcast message to the contact supplied in the CSV file. If false, Notifi will also send the broadcast message to contacts in the Notifi database registered to the account number, unless restricted by other selected criteria. The use case for this attribute is to provide a complete list of contacts for a broadcast message, which requires the attribute to be set to true for all rows in the CSV file. Broadcast messages are sent to Supplemental Contacts in addition to eligible registered contacts. Broadcast messages are sent to Default Contacts only when there are no contacts in the Notifi database registered to the account number.\nUse Case Examples for CSV File The supported attributes for CSV file upload in the Broadcast tool support the following use cases:\nProvide a list of account numbers - Notifi will send the broadcast message to contacts registered in the Notifi database to the provided account numbers. The file must not contain duplicate account numbers. Provide account numbers and supplemental contacts - Notifi will send the broadcast message to contacts registered in the Notifi database to the provided account numbers and to the provided supplemental contacts. The file must not contain duplicate account numbers. Provide account numbers and default contacts - Notifi will send the broadcast message to contacts registered in the Notifi database to the provided account numbers or to the provided default contacts if there are no contacts registered in the Notifi database for a specific account number. The file must not contain duplicate account numbers. Provide account numbers and contacts and ignore subscribed contacts - Notifi will send the broadcast message only to the contacts provided in the CSV file. This is the only use case that allows the CSV file to contain duplicate account numbers. Example 1 - CSV with Account Numbers Only account\r123456789010\r123456789011\r123456789012\r123456789013\rExample 2 - CSV with Account Numbers and Supplemental Contacts account,contact,channel,supplemental\r123456789010,username@example.com,E_MAIL,true\r123456789011,15551234567,SMS,true\r123456789012,user@kubra.com,E_MAIL,true\r123456789013,customer@abcenergy.com,E_MAIL,true\rExample 3 - Account Numbers and Default Contacts account,contact,channel,supplemental\r123456789010,username@example.com,E_MAIL,false\r123456789011,15551234567,SMS,false\r123456789012,user@kubra.com,E_MAIL,false\r123456789013,customer@abcenergy.com,E_MAIL,false\rExample 4 - Account Numbers and Contacts, Ignore Subscribed Contacts account,contact,channel,ignoreSubscribedContacts\r123456789010,username@example.com,E_MAIL,true\r123456789011,15551234567,SMS,true\r123456789012,user@kubra.com,E_MAIL,true\r123456789013,customer@abcenergy.com,E_MAIL,true\rThis example allows you to include duplicate account numbers to provide more than one contact for a single account. If you use this example format, the ignoreSubscribedContacts attribute must be included and must be set to true for all rows in the file.\n(Optional) Set Subscriptions To Filter On To optionally designate only contacts subscribed to specific messaging programs such as Outage, Bill Ready, Payment Reminder, or Usage (will be dependent on your configuration) to receive the broadcast message, you can choose one or many subscriptions that will be provided to Notifi to help down-select which contacts the broadcast message is sent to.\nNote\rWhile subscriptions selected will affect the eventual number of messages sent, they will not affect the count of accounts seen in the broadcast details dialog when sending or scheduling a broadcast.\nSave a Draft To save a draft broadcast message without sending it or scheduling it to be sent, click the Save without Sending button on the create message form.\nTest a Message The Test section of the create message form allows you to send a test message to check that a broadcast message sounds or appears correctly before you send the broadcast message to the selected recipients.\nTo send a test message:\nHold your mouse cursor over the Add Contact text. Select a channel for the contact you want to use for the test message. Enter the contact information in the text box. (Optional) Select the language you want to use for the test message. Repeat steps 1-4 for any additional contacts you want to include in the test. Click the Send Test button. Send a Message Immediately The Schedule section of the create message form allows you to send a broadcast message to the selected recipients.\nTo send a broadcast message immediately:\nClick the Send Immediately checkbox. Click the Send Broadcast button. Review the details for the message. Click the Yes button to confirm message delivery. Note\rContacts with an active do not disturb period at the time the broadcast is sent will receive the message when their do not disturb period ends.\nSchedule a Message for Later Delivery The Schedule section of the create message form allows you to schedule a broadcast message for later delivery to the selected recipients.\nTo schedule a broadcast message for later delivery:\nClick the Date field. Select a date and time in the pop-up window. The slider at the bottom of the pop-up window allows you to select a time. Click the Done button. Click the Send Broadcast button. Review the details for the scheduled message. Click the Yes button to confirm message scheduling. To clear a selected date and time, click the Unschedule button.\nNote\rThe Broadcast tool uses your computer’s current local time zone as the time zone for scheduled broadcast messages. Contacts with an active do not disturb period at the time the broadcast is scheduled will receive the message when their do not disturb period ends.\nMonitoring the Status of a Broadcast To check the status of a broadcast that is in the process of sending, you can select a previously-created broadcast that is currently sending. The message that opens will not be editable, but it is possible to view the content that is being sent. You can see a percentage-based status bar at the top of the screen that provides a view of how much of the broadcast has been sent at this moment.\nThe progress of this bar will be a near-realtime view of how quickly messages are passing through the event handling and message sending segments of Notifi. The progress bar data is based on the quantity of events that have been processed divided by the number of events submitted.\nAs the broadcast is starting, the progress bar might be somewhat volatile: this is normal. The volatility is a result of the number of events submitted to Notifi being low and not a reflection of the total number of events. As all the events are submitted, the progress bar should indicate a more accurate view of the actual state of how much of the broadcast has been sent to KUBRA’s method aggregators.\nEdit a Broadcast Message To resume working on a draft message or to edit a message that is pending delivery, select the message name from the list in the Broadcast tool. You may need to select the “Composing” or “Pending” message status to see the message name in the list.\nYou cannot edit a broadcast message after it has been sent. To create a new broadcast message with content based on a previously sent message, you must create a new broadcast and copy over the template content.\nCancel a Broadcast Message To cancel a broadcast message, click the Cancel Broadcast button at the bottom of the create message form.\nIf the broadcast message is being sent, you can abort the message. Some individual messages may still be delivered to recipients if they were already sent for delivery before the message was aborted.\nCopy a Broadcast Notifi lets you copy a broadcast, allowing you to duplicate a previously created broadcast. To copy the broadcast, click on the green Copy button to the right of the broadcast.\nThe new copy will have the same verbiage, templates, and criteria as your original version. If you delete the recipient CSV file, it deletes the CSV file from the original as well.\nUpload a Broadcast Audio File Info\rThe audio file upload functionality is only available with Notifi 4.0 after KUBRA has configured voice calling templates to use the audio files.\nNotifi lets you upload a new audio file via the UI to supplement Text-to-Speech when creating an IVR template. The IVR templates have two template types: Audio file and Text-to-Speech. Broadcast supports either Audio file or Text-to-Speech, but not both.\nNew broadcasts will default to the Text-to-Speech IVR template type.\nTo upload an audio file:\nCheck the Audio file box in Voice Template Type to enable the Upload button. Click the File upload button and select a supported audio file (see note below). Note\rThe max supported file size for an audio file is 50 MB. The audio file length should not exceed 10 minutes. The preferred audio file format is .wav.\nOnce the audio file is uploaded successfully, the audio file name will appear in a tag below the file upload area.\nTo delete the audio file, click the delete button to the right of the audio file name tag. Clicking the delete button will remove the audio file from the broadcast and re-enable Text functionality.\nExisting broadcasts will default to a type based on template data. If an audio file exists - default to Audio file. If no audio file exists - default to Text-to-Speech. Warning\rUploading an audio file will override Text-to-Speech for all locales. The uploaded file will be sent to all contacts regardless of language preference. The audio file will be transcoded for the phone system as-needed.\nSupported MIME types:\nMIME TYPE audio/mpeg mpeg layer 3 audio audio/wav wav format audio audio/wave wav format audio audio/x-wav wav format audio audio/aiff audio interchange file format audio/x-aifc audio interchange file format audio/x-aiff audio interchange file format audio/x-gsm GSM audio format audio/gsm GSM audio format audio/ulaw μ-law audio format PreBroadcast Checklist Refer to the PreBroadcast checklist to confirm if you have completed all steps for a successful broadcast.\nAttachments\rprebroadcast-checklist.pdf\r(55 kb)",

    "content": "Introduction This document outlines the structure of a delivery node file. Delivery node files are assumed to be complete snapshots of delivery node data, as opposed to incremental updates to delivery node data. This means that every delivery node file must contain at least one valid delivery node to be processed successfully.\nStorm Center uses the term “delivery node” to refer to locations with IDs in an Outage Management System. For example, these could be premises, meters, or transformers. Although it is not a requirement, KUBRA expects delivery node files to include multiple valid delivery nodes to represent all physical locations in the area indicated by the region file that could potentially be affected by outages.\nDelivery node files must be delivered via HTTPS POST requests to an endpoint specified by the Data Feeds application.\nAttachments\rdn-schema.xsd\r(1 kb)\rdn.json\r(1 kb)\rdn.jsonl\r(0 kb)\rdn.xml\r(1 kb)\rdn_areaId.json\r(2 kb)\rdn_areaId.jsonl\r(1 kb)\rdn_areaId.xml\r(4 kb)\rGeographic Coordinate System The coordinates of each delivery node must be provided in EPSG:4326, also known as WGS84. There is currently no support for providing coordinates in other geographic projection systems. For details about the EPSG:4326 coordinate system, access the specification provided by Spatial Reference External link opens in new tab\r.\nDelivery Node Elements A deliveryNode member MUST contain at least the following elements:\nElement Description id A string indicating the external id in your Outage Management System (OMS). latitude A number indicating the latitude in EPSG:4326 geographic coordinate system in Decimal Degrees format. longitude A number indicating the longitude in EPSG:4326 geographic coordinate system in Decimal Degrees format. A deliveryNode member MAY contain the following elements:\nElement Description customersServed An integer indicating the number of customers served by the delivery node. If the value supplied in the Delivery Node file is null, Storm Center will assume a value of 1. areas An array of areaType and areaId elements associated with the delivery node. These elements are specified to override spatial scanning. The value for areaType must match the value selected in the Create New Thematic form in Instance Manager. areaType values are case-sensitive and must be 15 characters or less. The values for areaId must match values for areaId provided in the corresponding thematic file. If areaId is not provided in the thematic file, name is used instead. regionCode An identifier for the region associated with the delivery node. This element is specified to override spatial scanning when there are multiple regions within the instance. If an instance has only one region, this element can be omitted, and Storm Center will assume the value of the only region associated with the instance. The value of this element is defined when you upload a region file in the Instance Manager user interface. regionCode values are case sensitive and must be 4 alphanumeric characters or less. articles An array of strings. Storm Center uses the number of strings to identify the number of customers served when a customersServed element is not provided. File Structure JSON The delivery node file can be sent in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format as specified in Internet Engineering Task Force standard RFC7159 External link opens in new tab\r. The file must contain a valid object in JSON. The .json file extension MUST be used to indicate file type.\nNote\rIf an organization has more than one million delivery node elements, or if the unzipped delivery node file size is 100MB or greater, KUBRA recommends that the organization use either JSON Lines format or XML format for the delivery node files instead of JSON format.\nExample 1 - A delivery node file in JSON format { \"nodes\": [ { \"id\": \"PHX01\", \"latitude\": 33.468867, \"longitude\": -112.050206, \"customersServed\": 2 }, { \"id\": \"PHX02\", \"latitude\": 33.48519, \"longitude\": -112.087285, \"customersServed\": 3 } ] }\rExample 2 - A delivery node file in JSON format with region code, area IDs, and area types { \"nodes\": [ { \"id\": \"PHX01\", \"latitude\": 33.468867, \"longitude\": -112.050206, \"customersServed\": 2, \"areas\": [ { \"areaId\": \"05\", \"areaType\": \"county\" }, { \"areaId\": \"85006\", \"areaType\": \"zip\" } ], \"regionCode\": \"AZ\" }, { \"id\": \"PHX02\", \"latitude\": 33.48519, \"longitude\": -112.087285, \"customersServed\": 3, \"areas\": [ { \"areaId\": \"05\", \"areaType\": \"county\" }, { \"areaId\": \"85006\", \"areaType\": \"zip\" } ], \"regionCode\": \"AZ\" } ] }\rJSON Lines The delivery node file can be sent in JSON Lines format as specified on jsonlines.org External link opens in new tab\r. Each line is a delivery node object ending in a new line character. Each delivery node is defined in JSON. The .jsonl file extension MUST be used to indicate file type.\nExample 3 - A delivery node file in JSON Lines format {\"id\": \"PHX01\", \"latitude\":33.468867, \"longitude\":-112.050206, \"customersServed\": 2} {\"id\": \"PHX02\", \"latitude\":33.485190, \"longitude\":-112.087285, \"customersServed\": 3} {\"id\": \"PHX03\", \"latitude\":33.485190, \"longitude\":-112.087285, \"customersServed\": 2}\rExample 4 - A delivery node file in JSON Lines format with region code, area IDs, and area types {\"id\": \"PHX01\", \"latitude\":33.468867, \"longitude\":-112.050206, \"customersServed\": 2, \"areas\": [{\"areaId\":\"05\",\"areaType\":\"county\"}, {\"areaId\":\"85006\",\"areaType\":\"zip\"}], \"regionCode\":\"AZ\"} {\"id\": \"PHX02\", \"latitude\":33.485190, \"longitude\":-112.087285, \"customersServed\": 3, \"areas\": [{\"areaId\":\"05\",\"areaType\":\"county\"}, {\"areaId\":\"85013\",\"areaType\":\"zip\"}], \"regionCode\":\"AZ\"} {\"id\": \"PHX03\", \"latitude\":33.485190, \"longitude\":-112.087285, \"customersServed\": 2, \"areas\": [{\"areaId\":\"05\",\"areaType\":\"county\"}], \"regionCode\":\"AZ\"}\rXML The delivery node file can be sent in XML format as specified by the W3 XML 1.0 5th Edition recommendation External link opens in new tab\radhering to the following schema:\ndn-schema.xsd\nThe .xml file extension MUST be used to indicate file type.\nExample 5 - A delivery node file in XML format \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e \u003ccatalog\u003e \u003cdn\u003e \u003cid\u003ePHX01\u003c/id\u003e \u003clatitude\u003e33.468867\u003c/latitude\u003e \u003clongitude\u003e-112.050206\u003c/longitude\u003e \u003ccustomersServed\u003e2\u003c/customersServed\u003e \u003c/dn\u003e \u003cdn\u003e \u003cid\u003ePHX02\u003c/id\u003e \u003clatitude\u003e33.485190\u003c/latitude\u003e \u003clongitude\u003e-112.087285\u003c/longitude\u003e \u003ccustomersServed\u003e3\u003c/customersServed\u003e \u003c/dn\u003e \u003cdn\u003e \u003cid\u003ePHX03\u003c/id\u003e \u003clatitude\u003e33.485190\u003c/latitude\u003e \u003clongitude\u003e-112.087285\u003c/longitude\u003e \u003ccustomersServed\u003e2\u003c/customersServed\u003e \u003c/dn\u003e \u003c/catalog\u003e\rExample 6 - A delivery node file in XML format with region code, area IDs, and area types \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e \u003ccatalog\u003e \u003cdn\u003e \u003cid\u003ePHX01\u003c/id\u003e \u003clatitude\u003e33.468867\u003c/latitude\u003e \u003clongitude\u003e-112.050206\u003c/longitude\u003e \u003ccustomersServed\u003e2\u003c/customersServed\u003e \u003careas\u003e \u003careaType\u003ecounty\u003c/areaType\u003e \u003careaId\u003e05\u003c/areaId\u003e \u003c/areas\u003e \u003careas\u003e \u003careaType\u003ezip\u003c/areaType\u003e \u003careaId\u003e85006\u003c/areaId\u003e \u003c/areas\u003e \u003cregionCode\u003eAZ\u003c/regionCode\u003e \u003c/dn\u003e \u003cdn\u003e \u003cid\u003ePHX02\u003c/id\u003e \u003clatitude\u003e33.485190\u003c/latitude\u003e \u003clongitude\u003e-112.087285\u003c/longitude\u003e \u003ccustomersServed\u003e3\u003c/customersServed\u003e \u003careas\u003e \u003careaType\u003ecounty\u003c/areaType\u003e \u003careaId\u003e05\u003c/areaId\u003e \u003c/areas\u003e \u003careas\u003e \u003careaType\u003ezip\u003c/areaType\u003e \u003careaId\u003e85013\u003c/areaId\u003e \u003c/areas\u003e \u003cregionCode\u003eAZ\u003c/regionCode\u003e \u003c/dn\u003e \u003cdn\u003e \u003cid\u003ePHX03\u003c/id\u003e \u003clatitude\u003e33.485190\u003c/latitude\u003e \u003clongitude\u003e-112.087285\u003c/longitude\u003e \u003ccustomersServed\u003e2\u003c/customersServed\u003e \u003careas\u003e \u003careaType\u003ecounty\u003c/areaType\u003e \u003careaId\u003e05\u003c/areaId\u003e \u003c/areas\u003e \u003cregionCode\u003eAZ\u003c/regionCode\u003e \u003c/dn\u003e \u003c/catalog\u003e\rNotes Storm Center will default the value of Customers Served to “1” in the absence of a value for Customers Served. Spatial scanning is used to determine a region for each delivery node if the delivery node file doesn’t include a region code for the delivery node. Spatial scanning is used to determine areas for each delivery node if the delivery node file doesn’t include an area ID for the delivery node of the appropriate area type. Each delivery node file must contain at least one valid delivery node member. Failure Scenarios Complete and partial delivery node file processing failures are described on the Data Feed Processing Failures page.\nIf a delivery node is discarded from the delivery node file, outage data associated with that delivery node will not appear on the map.\nIf the areaId for an area type not selected to filter delivery nodes is invalid, the delivery node will not be discarded from the delivery node file, but outage information related to that delivery node will not appear in the outage layer for that area type or in the summary report for that area type. For example, if a map view includes both county and ZIP code area types, delivery nodes are filtered by county, and a delivery node has an invalid ZIP code areaId, then outage information related to that delivery node will not appear on the “View outages by ZIP Code” map layer or in the summary report for outages by ZIP Code.\nNote\rFor information on selecting an area type to filter delivery nodes, see the Connect Data Files and Feeds page of the Configuration Guide.\nCompression GZip External link opens in new tab\rfile compression is supported for all file types. All GZip compressed files should end with .gz, such as dn_20180101123045.json.gz.",

These are also referred to as unplanned outages.\nAn outage member MUST contain at least the following elements:\nElement Description id A string indicating the external ID in your Outage Management System (OMS). affectedDeliveryNodes An array of affectedDeliveryNodes members representing the affected delivery nodes or an empty array. An outage member MAY contain the following elements:\nElement Description crewStatus A string indicating the crew status, or a code which can be mapped to a specific string. crewIconIndicator A boolean used to determine whether the crew icon is shown for the outage location on the Storm Center map. If “True,” the crew icon will be shown. If “False,” the crew icon will not be shown. This element is used by Storm Center and is not used by Notifi. etr A dateTime representing the date and time of estimated time of restoration (ETR) in ISO-8601 External link opens in new tab\rformat. etrConfidence A string representing the confidence level of the ETR. The default value is LOW. This value is case sensitive and must match exactly one of the following values: LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. ETR Confidence is used by Notifi and is not used by Storm Center. cause A string representing the cause of the outage, or a code which can be mapped to a specific string. comments A string representing comments for the outage. startedAt A dateTime representing the date and time when the outage started in ISO-8601 format. updatedAt A dateTime representing the date and time when the outage status was last updated in ISO-8601 format. restoredAt A dateTime representing the date and time when the outage was restored in ISO-8601 format. This element is used by Storm Center and is not used by Notifi. outageConfirmed A boolean that indicates whether the outage has been confirmed by a customer. This element is used by Notifi and is not used by Storm Center. metadata An object to support custom data. This can include custom properties to be displayed with the outage that are not represented in the other elements of the outage member. Supported data types for metadata objects are string, number, percentage, datetime, and HTML markup. The following is an example of a metadata object with two properties:\n\"metadata\" : {\r\"affectedTransformers\": \"3\",\r\"environmentStatus\": \"UNSAFE\"\r}\rAffected Delivery Node Elements An affectedDeliveryNodes member MUST contain at least the following elements:\nElement Description dnId A string indicating the delivery node ID. An affectedDeliveryNodes member MAY contain the following elements:\nElement Description confidence A string representing the confidence level. The default value is LOW. This value is case sensitive and must match exactly one of the following values: LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. This element is used by Notifi and is not used by Storm Center. callbackContact (see Note) A string representing the callback contact information such as a phone number or email. This element is used by Notifi and is not used by Storm Center. reported A boolean to determine whether the outage for the affected delivery node was reported by a customer. This element is used by Notifi and is not used by Storm Center. Note\rNotifi may not have additional data about the delivery node, such as the address, available when sending outage messages to the callback contact. This fact should be considered and tested when designing message templates.\nRestoration Elements A restorations wrapper member is used to encapsulate the restoration elements. These are also referred to as explicit restorations.\nNote\rRestoration elements are not required as part of an outage file. Currently, the Notifi solution uses restoration data to provide automated messages to customers, but Storm Center does not use restoration data.\nA restoration member MUST contain at least the following elements:\nElement Description id A string indicating the external ID in your Outage Management System (OMS). restoredDeliveryNodes An array of restoredDeliveryNodes members representing the restored delivery nodes. A restoration member MAY contain the following elements:\nElement Description restoredAt A dateTime representing the date and time when the outage was restored in ISO-8601 format. restorationConfidence A string representing the confidence level of the restoration. The default value is LOW. This value is case sensitive and must match exactly one of the following values: LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. customersRestored The number of customers restored. cause A string representing the cause of the restoration, or a code which can be mapped to a specific string. comments A string representing comments for the outage. metadata An object to support custom data. This can include custom properties to be displayed with the outage that are not represented in the other elements of the outage member. Supported data types for metadata objects are string, number, percentage, datetime, and HTML markup. Restored Delivery Node Elements A restoredDeliveryNodes member MUST contain at least the following elements:\nElement Description dnId A string indicating the delivery node ID. A restoredDeliveryNodes member MAY contain the following elements:\nElement Description confidence A string representing the confidence level. The default value is LOW. This value is case sensitive and must match exactly one of the following values: LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. callbackContact A string representing the callback contact information such as a phone number or email. reported A boolean to determine whether the outage for the affected delivery node was reported by a customer. Cancellation Elements A cancellations wrapper member is used to encapsulate the cancellation elements.\nNote\rCancellation elements are used by Notifi to differentiate cancelled outages from restorations to determine the correct message to send to affected customers. Storm Center does not use cancellation data.\nA cancellation member MUST contain at least the following elements:\nElement Description id A string indicating the external ID in your Outage Management System (OMS). cancelledDeliveryNodes An array of cancelledDeliveryNodes members representing the delivery nodes affected by the cancelled outage. A cancellation member MAY contain the following elements:\nElement Description metadata An object to support custom data. This can include custom properties to be displayed with the outage that are not represented in the other elements of the outage member. Supported data types for metadata objects are string, number, percentage, datetime, and HTML markup. Cancelled Delivery Node Elements A cancelledDeliveryNodes member MUST contain at least the following elements:\nElement Description dnId A string indicating the delivery node ID. A cancelledDeliveryNodes member MAY contain the following elements:\nElement Description confidence A string representing the confidence level. The default value is LOW. This value is case sensitive and must match exactly one of the following values: LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. callbackContact A string representing the callback contact information such as a phone number or email. reported A boolean to determine whether the outage for the affected delivery node was reported by a customer. Delivery Node Associated with Multiple Outages If a delivery node ID is included in an outage file as an affected delivery node for more than one outage, the outage file will be processed without errors. The number of customers affected for individual outage location icon information panels will include all affected delivery nodes. The number of customers affected for cluster icon information panels, outage summary reports, and the outage summary information in the overview panel will include only distinct (non-duplicate) delivery nodes.\nFailure Scenarios Complete and partial outage file processing failures are described on the Data Feed Processing Failures page.\nCompression GZip External link opens in new tab\rfile compression is supported for all file types.

    "content": "Notifi uses message templates for proactive messages that include static content and data elements. The Template Manager tool allows you to review the content of these message templates and to submit changes to the templates for review and promotion from a test instance to the production instance.\nInfo\rThe Template Manager tool only contains templates for proactive (one-way, outbound) messages. Interactive automated conversations (two-way messages) are managed separately. You must submit a ticket to KUBRA support for any requested changes to conversation verbiage.\nAccess Access to the Template Manager tool may require a second login using the same username and password you use for the Notifi Management Console.\nThe Template Manager tool may open in a new browser tab. You may need to close the tab and/or use the primary Notifi Management Console URL to access other Notifi management tools.\nNavigation The Template Manager tool includes the following sections:\nEdit Templates Latest Activity Deploy Changes By default, the tool opens to show the Edit Templates section.\nEdit Templates The Edit Templates section shows options for message channels supported by the Notifi implementation and an option called “Globals” for elements shared by multiple message templates. If the Notifi implementation supports more than one language, there is a language selection option under each channel and under the Globals option.\nAfter you select a message channel and a language if applicable, you will see a list of message templates or assets organized by message topic. You can select a template to view a preview or edit its contents.\nAfter you click the Edit button to edit a specific template, you will see an Edit Template panel with four tabs:\nBody - a rich-text editor for the template body content Parts - plain-text fields for the message subject and the message body (only applicable for email templates) Placeholders - plain-text fields for variables such as the message title (only applicable for email templates) Preview - a preview of any changes you have made in the Body tab or the Placeholders tab Note\rEdits you make in the Body tab do NOT copy over to the Parts tab automatically. The Plaintext field in the Parts tab should contain the plain-text version of the email body content, excluding HTML annotations. This plain-text version is used by the Notifi History tool. The plain-text version of the email body will also be sent to recipients who cannot receive rich-text email messages.\nTo save your changes, click the Save button. To discard your changes, click the Cancel button.\nTips for Editing Templates Variable values will not be the same length as the variable in the message template. SMS or text messages have a maximum character limit of 160 characters in the U.S. and 140 characters in Canada for English language messages. Voice templates have a maximum Unicode character limit of 4,096 characters. Punctuation such as commas and periods in voice templates will be interpreted as natural pauses. The text-to-speech program used for voice messages will make assumptions about how to pronounce numbers, dates, times, amounts of money and other abbreviations. You can format initialisms or acronyms in voice templates with a space between each letter to have the text-to-speech program pronounce each letter separately - for example, E T R would be read as “ee tee ar.” Template Variables There are four types of variable or conditional content used in Notifi message templates:\nPlaceholders or local variables such as {$ title $}, which refers to the Title placeholder for an email template. These variables can be used in more than one location within a specific message template and are managed in the Placeholders section of the Edit Template form. Global variables such as {$ g_sms_contact $} or {$ g_resume_alerts_link $}. These variables can be used in more than one message template and are managed in the Globals section of the Template Manager tool. Notifi variables that use event data to create messages for customers, such as {{Subscriptions.contactId}} for a contact ID such as an email address or a user-provided nickname for the email address, or {{Address.longAddress}} for the long form of the street address. Conditional Notifi expressions such as the expression {{#if (crewsAreDispatched CrewStatus)}}Our crews have been assigned to investigate the situation.{{/if}}, which will include the text “Our crews have been assigned to investigate the situation.” if the CrewStatus variable value indicates that crews have been dispatched. Notifi templates also use standard HTML such as \u003ca href=\"www.example.com\"\u003eExample hypertext\u003c/a\u003e for hypertext and \u003cstrong\u003ebold words\u003c/strong\u003e for bold text.\nTip\rOpening and closing characters are required for both variable content and HTML elements. If you would like to make changes to variables or conditional Notifi expressions, please contact KUBRA support for assistance.\nEdit Globals After you select the Globals option and a language if applicable, you will see a file called global.yml. Select the file name to view or edit a list of global values used by multiple message templates.\nSome implementations will also have environment-specific files in the Globals section. These files use names such as global.test.yml for the Test environment and global.prod.yml for the Production environment. Values in an environment-specific file will override the values in the main global.yml file.\nYou can use the environment-specific global files to set environment-specific values such as test links and phone numbers if those items are different from the production items.\nLatest Activity The Latest Activity section shows a list of recent template change deployments to either the test environment or the production environment.\nSelect a deployment to view the following information:\nService Name - the name of the service used for the deployment Date - the date and time at which the deployment was made Files - a list of template files changed by the deployment Changes - a list of changes made to the template files Click the View Details link for a specific change to view the following information:\nDescription - a brief description of the change. Files - the location of the template files that were changed. Diff - an excerpt of the file content focusing on the content that changed. Removed content is shown in red with a “-” symbol at the start of the row. Added content is shown in green with a “+” symbol at the start of the row. Date - the date and time at which the change was made. By - the username of the person who made the change. Deploy Changes The Deploy Changes section shows a list of environments and the number of changes, if any, that are ready to be deployed to the environment.\nSelect an environment name to view changes to the environment and deploy the changes. To view details about a specific change, click the View Details link next to the change description. The details shown are the same as in the Latest Activity section\nIf there are no pending changes for an environment, the Deploy button will be disabled.\nTo deploy changes, click the Deploy button. Changes always move from development to test or from test to production.\nExamples of Template Edits Example 1 - Add an additional note to an outage email Access the “Edit Templates” section of the Template Manager tool. Select “Email” and “English.” Select the name of the outage template file, such as “out_new.njk.” Click the Edit button. In the Body tab, scan the template for the location where you want to add the additional content. Type the new content into the outage template body. Be careful not to disturb any variables or conditional elements. In the Parts tab, scan the template for the location where you want to add the additional content, and copy the change you made in the Body tab. Be careful not to disturb any variables or conditional elements. Use the Preview option to check the results of your edits. Click the Save button to save your changes. Repeat these steps for templates in other supported languages, replacing “English” with the appropriate language, as needed.\nExample 2 - Change a term used in an English SMS message to reduce character count Access the “Edit Templates” section of the Template Manager tool. Select “SMS” and “English.” Select the name of the template file, such as “contact_paused.njk.” Click the Edit button. Scan the template for the term you want to change. Edit the template content. Use the Preview option to check the results of your edit. Click the Save button to save your changes. Example 3 - Update the company name Access the “Edit Templates” section of the Template Manager tool. Select “Globals.” Select the “global.yml” file. Click the Edit button. Locate the variable or variables for the company name. There may be more than one version, such as an SMS Greeting, a Formal Company Name, and a Sender Name. Edit the variables. Click the Save button to save your changes.",

    "content": "The Notifi Admin tool allows you to manage some configurable features of the Notifi system related to outbound message delivery.\nYour implementation may not include all of the settings described here, depending on the implementation’s configuration.\nOptional Settings Real-Time Outage Status Notifi supports two methods for retrieving outage status information: a web service call to the Outage Management System (OMS) or a check of the latest file in the Notifi Outage Hub.\nWhen the real-time outage status toggle is set to ON, Notifi will make web service calls to the utility’s OMS to retrieve outage status information.\nWhen the real-time outage status toggle is set to OFF, Notifi will check the latest file in the Notifi Outage Hub to retrieve outage status information.\nThe real-time outage status toggle is set to ON by default. If you want to reduce the number of web service calls to the OMS (and reduce the overall load on the system), you can turn the real-time outage status toggle to OFF.\nFull Proactive Messaging Notifi supports two methods for delivering outage status update messages: full proactive messaging and partial proactive messaging.\nWhen the full proactive messaging toggle is set to ON, Notifi will send outage updates to all contacts of affected accounts enrolled to receive outage messages.\nWhen the full proactive messaging toggle is set to OFF, Notifi will send outage updates to contacts of affected accounts enrolled to receive outage messages only when a customer associated with the account has reported an outage at their location. This is also known as partial proactive messaging.\nConversation in Maintenance Mode If a Notifi implementation includes both two-way SMS text messaging and web chat, the conversation in maintenance mode toggle will affect both channels.\nWhen the conversation in maintenance mode toggle is set to ON, Notifi will respond to messages sent by customers to the Notifi system with the maintenance message template (a message that lets the customer know that the system is undergoing maintenance).\nWhen the conversation in maintenance mode toggle is set to OFF, Notifi will respond to messages sent by customers with the appropriate template depending on the keyword sent by the customer or the detected customer intent.\nThe conversation in maintenance mode toggle is set to OFF by default.\nMute Settings You can use mute settings if you have bad data coming from a back-end system or for other temporary situations where you want to suppress messages sent from Notifi. When a mute setting is turned on, Notifi will still process data and generate messages for received events, but it will not send the message to recipients. Messages that are muted this way are not sent to recipients when the mute setting is turned off.\nMute settings only affect outbound or proactive messages from the Notifi system to customer contacts. To adjust messaging for two-way SMS text conversations, you must use the Conversation in Maintenance Mode toggle, if it is available for your implementation.\nYou can turn on the “Mute All” setting to stop all automated proactive messages, or you can turn on one of the other mute settings to mute\na specific message category, all messages for a communication channel, a specific type of outage status message, or all messages for an operating company. For example, turning on a “Mute Outage” setting will stop automated communications about outages, such as outage notifications, ETR updates, and restoration notifications.\nTo turn on a mute setting, click and drag the white button next to the setting you want to change from left to right. The button should move from the OFF position to the ON position.\nTo turn off a mute setting, click and drag the white button next to the setting you want to change from right to left. The button should move from the ON position to the OFF position.\nMute System Pauses If you turn on the “Mute System Pauses” setting, Notifi will stop sending messages to customers letting the customer know when other message types have been automatically paused.\nMuting messages about automatic system pauses does not turn off the excessive messaging protection feature - messages to customer contacts will still be automatically paused according to the configured excessive messaging protection rules.",

This element is required when an array of affectedDeliveryNodes is not provided. affectedDeliveryNodes An array of affectedDeliveryNodes members representing the affected delivery nodes or an empty array. This element is required unless a customersAffected element and a geometry element are provided. geometry A set of coordinates representing the area affected by the planned outage, in WKT External link opens in new tab\rformat. Only Point, MultiPoint, LineString, Polygon, and MultiPolygon types will be accepted. This element is required when an array of affectedDeliveryNodes is not provided. metadata An object to support custom data. This can include custom properties to be displayed with the planned outage that are not represented in the other elements of the plannedOutage member. Supported data types for metadata objects are string, number, percentage, datetime, and HTML markup. Relationships between affectedDeliveryNodes, customersAffected, and geometry Elements There are multiple options for presenting information about the area affected by a planned outage and the number of customers affected by a planned outage, depending on the set of optional elements included in the planned outages file.\nElements Included Source for Area Affected Source for Customers Affected affectedDeliveryNodes Calculation using latitude and longitude values from delivery nodes identified by dnId Calculation using customers served values from delivery nodes identified by dnId affectedDeliveryNodes and geometry Coordinates provided in geometry Calculation using customers served values from delivery nodes identified by dnId affectedDeliveryNodes and customersAffected Calculation using latitude and longitude values from delivery nodes identified by dnId Value provided as customersAffected affectedDeliveryNodes, customersAffected, and geometry Coordinates provided in geometry Value provided as customersAffected customersAffected and geometry Coordinates provided in geometry Value provided as customersAffected Geographic Coordinate System for Geometry Elements Planned outage files support a geometry element in Well-known text (WKT) External link opens in new tab\rformat. Of the geometric objects supported by WKT, planned outage files only support Point, MultiPoint, LineString, Polygon, and MultiPolygon.\nCoordinate pairs must be presented with the longitude followed by the latitude. The coordinate points of each geometry element must be provided in EPSG:4326, also known as WGS84. There is currently no support for providing coordinates in other geographic projection systems.

These features are described on the Notifi Advanced Reporting page.\nStandard Report Dashboards There are up to seven standard dashboards available, depending on an organization’s configuration:\nRegistrations – shows information about registrations over time, from different sources, by channel, by area, and by operating company (if applicable), as well as the number of pending registrations. Enrollment Audit – shows information about the number of customer contacts opted in or opted out of messages by date and by message category. Enrollments – shows information about the total number of customer contacts enrolled by channel, message category, and month as a running total. Messaging – shows information about the number and type of messages sent and received by Notifi over time, by channel, by message category, and by delivery status.

This dashboard includes a date filter that shows messages sent in the previous full month by default. This dashboard also includes an environment filter that shows messages from the test environment, the production environment, or both. Outage Summary - shows information about outage messages including the number of outage notifications for each outage message template and the number of outage reporting (OUT) and outage status (STAT) conversations started and completed.

Broadcast Summary - shows information about recent broadcasts grouped by broadcast name such as total messages sent, messages by channel, and processing time. The Broadcast Summary also includes a delivery summary breakdown.

The tool allows for creating and archiving image resources that can then be used in Storm Center, IncidentWatch, or Notifi. Images uploaded using IRM will only be available for that specific client, and are automatically cached using CloudFront to avoid issues with website load during large events.\nIRM supports the following image file types: JPEG, GIF, PNG, and SVG. The maximum file size allowed is 1 MB.\nSystem Default Preferences While you can upload custom images that you might need in any product, KUBRA still maintains system default images that it recommends for use within its products.\nTo view these System Default Images, check the Show System Default Preferences checkbox. These are KUBRA-created images and vectors that work best on our products.\nImage Properties IRM asks for three parameters when uploading an image: the name, the image itself, and tags. The name and tags are modifiable if you want to edit them but the image cannot be changed. Any images that need to be changed will need the creation of a new IRM entry.\nImage Tags Tags help in searching and narrowing down specific images. They have a key-value pair association that can be created for that image. There is no limit on the number of tags you can associate with an image.\nYou can use the Search functionality to search by tags.\nImage Archive Functionality You can archive an image already uploaded on IRM. Archiving exists to hide images that will not be used. Archived images are, however, still accessible by any product using them.\nClick on the image you want to archive in the list of images. The image and its properties will open up on the right. Click on the Archive button in the top right. View Archived images by checking the Show Archive checkbox.\nNote\rWhy do we not allow image deletion? In case any IRM image is being used within a product, deleting an image would cause the product to not function optimally. KUBRA wants to avoid that.\nImage Unarchive Functionality You can unarchive images that have previously been archived. Click on the image you want to archive. On the right, click on the Un-Archive button.\nSort By Functionality The Sort By functionality allows you to sort by image name, either alphabetically or reverse alphabetically.\nBenefits of IRM Simplifies adding and standardizing images. Allows for platform products to be more customizable. Creates path URLs to help reference images. Caches images to allow for faster site load times. Allows for images to be searched easily by allowing image tagging. Note\rYou can only reference path URLs from IRM in Storm Center 5 so far but image functionality will be extended to other platform products.\nAccess IRM Navigate to the Image Resource Manager website.

The region history list shows the date, time, region name, and region code for each file upload. The region history list also includes a button to download a copy of a specific region file and the user code for the user who uploaded the region file.\nThe Instances Using Regions list on the Region Management screen shows the names of the instances for the tenant account and the name of the region file connected to each instance in the format “instance name : region file name.”\nSet Up Thematic Data To upload and manage thematic files for your Storm Center instances, use the Thematics sub-section under Shared Resources in the left navigation panel of the Instance Manager Storm Center application.\nThematic files represent geographic areas within a region, such as counties, ZIP codes or other postal codes, or City/Town/Village (CTV) areas. Storm Center uses thematic files to create summary reports of outage information and to visually represent the number of outages by area. Storm Center also uses thematic files to validate the locations of delivery nodes from delivery node files.\nTo add a new thematic data file:\nClick the Add Thematic button. Enter a name for the thematic file - this is how you will identify the thematic file in other areas of the Instance Manager. The thematic name can be 1-50 alphanumeric characters and may contain whitespace, underscore, period, and hyphen characters. Select the area type. The default options are “zip” for ZIP code, “county” for county, and “ctv” for City/Town/Village areas. If you select “CUSTOM,” you must provide a name for the custom area type. Each Custom area type you enter will be available in the drop-down for any additional thematic files you set up for your instance. Area type values are case-sensitive and must be 15 characters or less. The values in the drop-down will match the case used for the original entry. References to area type in individual thematic files and delivery node files MUST match the case shown. If applicable, provide the hierarchy for the thematic. The item or items you list in the hierarchy field must match the labels for the data you provide in the thematic file. You only need to list hierarchy levels which are higher than the level of the thematic type. For example, you can list “state” as a hierarchy level above “county” for a county thematic. The area type values included in the hierarchy are case sensitive. References to hierarchy values in thematic files and delivery node files MUST match the case shown. Upload a GeoJSON thematic file that adheres to the Thematic File Specification. Click the Submit button. Repeat this process for each type of thematic you want to use for the map.\nThe application will create an ID for the thematic data feed after you save a new thematic name. This ID will be part of the HTTPS URL you can use to provide updated thematic files as needed.\nTo edit, update, or delete a thematic, click on the thematic name in the list under the Add Thematic button.\nNote\rYou cannot delete a thematic file that is being used by an instance.\nThe Edit Thematic screen includes the thematic name, the area type, the hierarchy, a thematic history list, a tool to manually upload a new thematic file, and the HTTPS URL for the thematic file endpoint. The thematic history list shows the date, time, thematic name, and hierarchy for each file upload. The thematic history list also includes a button to download a copy of a specific thematic file and the user code for the user who uploaded the thematic file.\nNote\rYou cannot change the area type of a thematic file after it is created.\nSet Up Outage and Delivery Node Data Feeds To identify and test data feeds for outage and delivery node files, use the Data Feeds application.\nIf your instance includes the optional Planned Outages module, you can also use the Data Feeds application to set up and test a data feed for planned outage files.\nOutage Feeds Outage files provide information about outages and the delivery nodes they affect. Storm Center uses outage files to create information panels for outage locations and outages by area, and to determine the location of outages by comparing data in outage files to data in delivery node files.\nTo manage outage data feeds, use the Outage Feeds Dashboard section of the Data Feeds application.\nTo set up a new outage feed:\nClick the Create Outage Feed button. Enter a name for the outage feed - this is how you will identify the outage feed in the Instance Manager application. To save the outage feed name, click the Submit button. The Data Feeds application will create an ID for the outage feed after you save a new outage feed name. This ID will be part of the HTTPS URL you use to provide outage files.\nYou can decide how often to provide new outage files based on how often you want to update the map views connected to the Storm Center instance. KUBRA recommends sending outage files every 15 minutes as a default.\nTo edit the name of an outage feed or to delete an outage feed, click the name of the feed in the Outage Feeds list on the Outage Feeds Dashboard. The screen that opens when you select an outage feed name also shows the HTTPS endpoint for the outage feed.\nNote\rYou cannot delete an outage feed that is being used by an instance.\nTo manually test outage data files for an outage feed, click the Upload Outage File button.\nSelect an outage feed name from the drop-down list. Upload an outage file that adheres to the Outage File Specification. Click the Upload button. This manual upload will also trigger a file processing job if there are instances connected to the outage feed.\nDelivery Node Feeds Delivery node files provide information about the geographic location of delivery nodes and the number of customers served by each delivery node. Storm Center uses delivery node files to determine the locations of outages and the number of customers affected by each outage by comparing data in outage files to data in delivery node files.\nTo manage delivery node feeds, use the Delivery Node Feeds Dashboard section of the Data Feeds application.\nTo set up a new delivery node feed:\nClick the Create Delivery Node Feed button. Enter a name for the delivery node feed - this is how you will identify the delivery node feed in the Instance Manager application. To save the delivery node feed name, click the Submit button.

    "content": "Typically, a Storm Center outage map provides two kinds of layers for showing outage information. One kind of layer shows outage location icons for individual outages and cluster icons for groups of outages. The other kind of layer shows the number or the percentage of customers affected by outages by shading a geographical area such as a county, municipality, or postal code area.\nWhen creating an Additional Map Layer, refer to the Create Additional Map Layer page.\nTo create an outage data layer, use the Data Layers sub-section of the Shared Resources section of the Instance Dashboard.\nLayer Name, Source, and Titles Click the Create Data Layer button. Enter a name for the layer - this name is how you will identify the layer in other areas of the Instance Manager; it will not show up on the map. Select an access restriction policy. The options available in the drop-down come from the policies created in the Access Restriction section of the Instance Dashboard. Select a layer type. “Thematic” is for showing outages by area and has a source type of ZIP (postal code), County, Cities/Towns/Villages (CTV), or a Custom thematic name, depending on the thematic file types you uploaded when you set up thematic data for the instance. “Outages” is for showing active outages by location and includes cluster icons for representing groups of nearby active outage locations. “Planned” is for showing planned outages by location and includes cluster icons for representing groups of nearby planned outage locations. This layer type is only available with the Planned Outages module. Enter titles for the layer for each language supported by the instance - these titles will be used at the top of the information panels on the map. If you want to use the name of the specific area (such as the county name) as the information panel title, enter ${name} in the layer title fields. If you want to include the name of the state in the information panel title, enter ${hierarchy.state} in the layer title fields. For an Outages layer, a Planned layer, or an Additional Map layer, enter a title for the information panels associated with individual outage icons and a title for the information panels associated with cluster icons. KUBRA recommends a maximum of 15-20 characters for these titles. You may need to adjust the length or formatting of the titles after testing them on a map to ensure that they display and wrap well. Layer Data Source and Information Panel Fields Under Layer Sources, select the region data you want to associate with the layer. Under Information Panel Fields, select the data fields you want to include in the information panels for the layer. The following table shows which data fields are available for thematic layers, for individual location icons in an outages layer, for cluster icons in an outages layer, for individual location icons in a planned layer, for cluster icons in a planned layer.\nData Field Thematic Layer Individual Location - Outages Layer Cluster - Outages Layer Individual Location - Planned Layer Cluster - Planned Layer Cause X X Comments X X Crew Status X Duration X End Time X X Estimated Restoration Time X X X Incident ID X X Metadata X X Number of Customers Affected X X X X X Number of Customers Served X Number of Outages X X X Percentage of Customers Affected X Start Time X X X X X Metadata Fields - Additional Data for Outage Location Information Panels In addition to the standard data fields, you can optionally define one or more Metadata fields to display additional types of data in the information panels for individual outage locations or individual planned outage locations.\nTo add a metadata field, click the Add Metadata Field button in the Individual Data subsection of the Information Panel Fields section for an Outages layer or a Planned layer.\nProvide a name for the metadata field. This name must match the name of a metadata element property supplied in outage data files submitted to Storm Center. Select a data type from the drop-down. Options are string number percentage datetime HTML markup Note\rElement names are case-sensitive. Ensure you think about case when naming elements.\nData Mapping for Outages Layers and Planned Outage Layers The Field Mappings selection of the data layer form associates data field mapping with one or more field types in the data layer. This allows the map to mask field values from an outage file, or planned outage file with customer-friendly or public-facing values.\nIf you want to provide mapping for one or more data fields in the information panel for individual active or planned outage location icons, click the Submit button at the bottom of the Create Data Layer form to save your in-progress layer and then follow the instructions to create data mapping.\nAfter you create the data mapping you want to use, return to the edit data layer form under Data Layers and click the Add Field Mapping Relationship button. Next, select a data field from the drop-down and then select the mapping name.\nNote\rData mapping can only be provided for crew status, cause, and metadata fields. Planned outage layers can include cause and metadata fields, but do not include crew status fields.\nExtra Text for Information Panels The Infobox Extra Text section of the data layer form associates configurable content blocks with the information panels in the data layer. This allows the map to show additional content at the bottom of the information panels, and can include different content for individual outage icon information panels than for cluster icon information panels.\nIf you want to include extra content at the bottom of the information panels, click the Submit button at the bottom of the create data layer form to save your in-progress layer and then follow the instructions to create a configurable content block.\nAfter you create the content blocks you want to use, return to the edit data layer form under Data Layers and select the content block name from the Info Panel Content Block drop-down field for the information panel you want to add the content to.\nStorm Center can optionally include expanded cluster information panels at some zoom levels. These information panels are associated with a cluster icon, but they show information for each of the individual outages elements included in the cluster. If you provide extra text for individual outage icon information panels, that text will also appear in the outage cards for each outage in an expanded cluster information panel.\nAdditional Settings for Outages Layers and Planned Outage Layers Crew Icon Indicator on individual outage location icons when the outage data indicates a crew is on site at the location can be defined in Range Expressions. However, you still need to click the Enable Crew Icon Indicator checkbox to ensure the crew icon is visible. This setting is not applicable for Planned Outage Layers. Crew indicators will be shown on the map when all of the following are true: this setting is enabled the data provided in the outage data feed for an outage location indicates that there is a crew at the location crew_icon is set to true in Range Expressions for that outage layer If you do not want to display polygons behind individual outage location icons to indicate the area affected by the outage when an outage affects three or more delivery nodes, click the Disable Polygons checkbox. Provide zoom settings and cluster tolerance. Enter a maximum zoom level at which to combine outage location icons into Clusters. Enter a zoom level at which to provide expanded outage information in the information panels for outage cluster icons - KUBRA recommends setting this zoom level one level below the Max Zoom to Cluster setting. If you do not want to show individual outage information in cluster icon information panels at any zoom level, set the Start Zoom to Paginate Outage to -1. Select a Cluster Tolerance Level on the slider between 20 and 40. Tip\rThe recommended Cluster Tolerance Level is based on the size of the outage location and cluster icons. If you are using the default WCAG-compliant icon set, KUBRA recommends setting the cluster tolerance to 35.\nEstimated Restoration Time Settings If you want to show expired estimated restoration time (ETR) values in the information panels for the layer, clear the Mask Expired ETR checkbox. This checkbox is selected by default. You may want to clear this checkbox if you are creating an internal-facing map and want to see all ETRs as reported from the source system for outage data, for example. Select an ETR grouping condition - options are “Latest ETR Any” and “Latest ETR All.” “Latest ETR Any” means that the map will display the latest ETR for outages in the cluster or area if any of the outages has a specific, valid ETR (not null or expired). If none of the outages in the cluster or area has a specific, valid ETR, the map will display the default message specified for null or expired ETRs in the Data Labels sub-section of the Shared Resources section. “Latest ETR All” means that the map will display the latest ETR for outages in the cluster or area only if all of the outages have a specific, valid ETR (not null or expired). If any of the outages in the cluster or area has a null or expired ETR, the map will display the default message for null or expired ETRs. Note\rThe Planned layer type uses these settings for the “End Time” field.\nRange Styles for Outage, Thematic, Planned Outage, and Additional Map Layers You can customize how a Storm Center layer looks by writing a JSON object. For a map data layer, each JSON object consists of properties representing the ranges.\nStorm Center provides 3 choices to assist you in writing your JSON object.\nSelect a pre-existing template under Apply Styling Template, modify if needed OR Copy a template from another layer in the same instance, modify if needed OR Write your own JSON object. This table lists all the choices you have while writing or editing a range on a JSON object.\nJSON property Description Possible use cases legendOrder Decides the order of the defined range in the legend. A legend order of -1 will hide this range style from the legend. rangeExpr Decides range conditions. See Range Expressions for more details. rangeLabel Defines the range label for each range, appears to the right of the icon in the map legend. Each defined range should have range labels in all languages supported for that instance of Storm Center. KUBRA recommends a maximum of 25 characters for these labels. rangeStyles Defines the styles associated with a range. Since it is an object that contains the styles, all options under Range Styles will be included in the table with a dot notation. rangeStyles.shape Defines all the characteristics of a polygon shape. These characteristics exist when there is a shape to represent for thematics or outage polygons. rangeStyles.shape.borderColor Defines the polygon’s border color. Use Hex color codes. rangeStyles.shape.borderOpacity Defines the polygon’s border opacity. Accepts a decimal value between and including 0 and 1. rangeStyles.shape.borderWeight Defines the polygon’s border weight. Accepts an integer value equal to or greater than 0. rangeStyles.shape.fillColor Defines the polygon’s fill color. Use Hex color codes. rangeStyles.shape.opacity Defines the polygon’s opacity. Accepts a decimal value between and including 0 and 1. rangeStyles.icon Defines all the characteristics of the icon specific to that range. These characteristics exist when there is an icon to represent the outage location. rangeStyles.icon.url Defines the url for the icon. KUBRA requires using the path URL from Image Resource Manager for this purpose. rangeStyles.icon.size Defines the icon size. Provide a width and height in pixels for the icon. Input accepted is an array [width, height]. rangeStyles.icon.anchor Defines the icon anchor. The coordinates of the “tip” of the icon (relative to its top left corner). The icon will be aligned so that this point is at the marker’s geographical location. Input accepted is an array [x,y]. rangeStyles.icon.labelValue Displays a map label for that icon. Clients can request specific values they want the label to display. You can use properties of the record for the label value, for example ${n_out}, ${cust_a.val}. rangeStyles.icon.labelAnchor Defines the icon label anchor. The coordinates of the “tip” of the icon label (relative to its top left corner). The label will be aligned so that this point is at the marker’s geographical location. Input accepted is an array [x,y]. rangeStyles.icon.opacity Defines icon opacity. Accepts a decimal value between and including 0 and 1. Range Expressions A range expression is a JSON property which decides range definition conditions. Conditions are defined over data fields. Each data field supports specific operators depending on the data type of the field.\nNote\rRange expressions can include one or more conditions using the \u0026\u0026 (AND) and || (OR) operators.\nYou can use the following conditions to define a range.\nCondition JSON parameter Data type Special features Cluster cluster boolean Special field indicating if the map element corresponds to a cluster or not. Cause cause string, JSON object Supports mapping tables; view warning below when using mapping tables for Range Expressions. Number of customers affected cust_a.val integer To access the value of cust_a, use the cust_a.val parameter. Percentage of customers affected perc_cust_a.val integer To access the value of perc_cust_a, use the perc_cust_a.val parameter. Comments comments string No special features. Crew icon crew_icon boolean To determine whether the crew icon is shown for the outage location on the Storm Center map. If True, the crew icon will be shown. If False, the crew icon will not be shown. However, you still need to click the Enable Crew Indicator checkbox to confirm the icon will be visible. Crew status crew_status string, JSON object Supports mapping tables; view warning below when using mapping tables for Range Expressions. Metadata metadata JSON object, supports integer, string, boolean Elements within the Metadata property support mapping tables depending on the configuration; view warning below when using mapping tables for Range Expressions. Number of outages n_out integer No special features. When using mapping tables for a range expression, you should reference mapping table languages with square brackets like parameter['language']. The languages available are EN-US, ES-ES, es-US, and fr-CA. For example, accessing the cause in French would be cause['fr-CA']. Ideally, we recommend using the default language used when creating the instance when you reference a language in the mapping table.\nEnsure you have an additional condition defining the parameter as not equal to null (to avoid an error when parsing the expression).\nFor example, “cause != null”. “cause != null \u0026\u0026 cause[‘EN-US’] == ‘Planned maintenance’” is an example of a condition that supports mapping tables.\nThe table below indicates the operators allowed with data types used in Range Expressions.\nData type Operators allowed boolean OR, AND, ==, !=, unary operator (!a) string OR, AND, ===, ==, !==, !=, can use (\u003c, \u003e, \u003c=, \u003e=) operators when lexical and case dependent matching integer OR, AND, ===, ==, !==, !=, \u003c, \u003e, \u003c=, \u003e=, +, -, *, /, unary operators (+a, -a, !a) Specific data fields are available for Range Expressions that work only with specific layers. Refer to the Layer Data Source and Information Panel Fields for more clarity.\nFor a sample template for each data layer type, refer to the sample JSON object attached below.\nJSON templates\routage-layer-crew-template.json\r(9 kb)\routage-layer-no-crew-template.json\r(4 kb)\rplanned-outage-layer-template.json\r(4 kb)\rthematic-layer-cust-affected-template.json\r(3 kb)\rthematic-layer-perc-cust-affected-template.json\r(3 kb)\rKUBRA-recommended icons and color/shape combinations Note\rStorm Center recommends using a combination of color and shape for location icons to help users with color vision deficiency. In addition, the colors for the recommended icons were selected to provide adequate contrast with the white color used for the icon shapes and with the background map.\nTip\rKUBRA recommends using the following image sizes (in pixels): 24x24 up to 32x32 for individual outages and 40x40 for outage clusters\nIcons for Outage layers These are the default KUBRA-recommended ADA-compliant icons for an outage layer or cluster outage layer:\nBlue Circle Yellow Star (five-pointed) Purple Triangle Red Diamond Green Square Orange Equals Sign Pink Star (six-pointed) Cluster These are the default KUBRA-recommended ADA-compliant icons for an outage layer with crew dispatched:\nBlue Circle with crew Yellow Star (five-pointed) with crew Purple Triangle with crew Red Diamond with crew Green Square with crew Orange Equals Sign with crew Pink Star (six-pointed) with crew Shown below is the default KUBRA single outage location icon.\nShown below is the KUBRA outage location crew icon.\nColor combinations for thematic layers These are the KUBRA-recommended ADA-compliant colors for thematic area:\nBlue Green Purple Red Yellow Orange Pink Gray Icons for Planned Outage layers These are the KUBRA-recommended ADA-compliant Planned outage icons:\nBlue Circle Yellow Star (five-pointed) Purple Triangle Red Diamond Green Square Orange Equals Sign Pink Star (six-pointed) Cluster Shown below is the default KUBRA single planned outage icon.\nLegend Labels The map legend includes an introductory label to indicate what the numbers for each range refer to. For example, if you chose “Customers Affected” as the method for determining ranges, you could use “Customers Affected” or “Affected by Outages” as the Legend Label.\nEnter labels to be used on the map legend for each language supported by the instance. KUBRA recommends a maximum of 25 characters for the map legend labels.\nLayer Field Labels You can determine the order of the data fields shown in the information panel for the layer and provide labels for each field. Data fields are arranged vertically - the field with order 1 will be at the top of the information panel, followed by the field with order 2, and so on.\nChoose an order for each data field and enter labels for each language supported by the instance. Labels for mobile browsers should be shorter than labels for desktop browsers so they can be read on a narrow screen.\nTip\rIf you want to include punctuation after the field labels in the information panel, you must include the punctuation in the text fields here.\nKUBRA recommends a maximum of 45 characters for information panel field labels. You may need to adjust the length or formatting of the labels after testing them on a map to ensure that they display and wrap well.\nNote\rThe field labels and order for Start Time, Estimated Restoration Time, End Time, and Number of Customers Affected are shared by the information panels for individual outage locations and outage clusters.\nButtons for External Links If you want to add one or more buttons to the bottom of the information panels for the layer, click the drop-down under Custom Footer Buttons and then select a button name from the list.\nBefore you can select a button here, you must create buttons.\nCustomers Affected Masking If you want to mask the exact number of customers affected at or below a specific value, click the Customer Masking checkbox and then enter a number. If you want to mask the exact percentage of customers affected at or below a specific value, click the % Customer Masking checkbox and then enter a number. The value or values you enter for customer masking here will be combined with verbiage you enter in the Shared Resources section of the Create New View form to create a label on the map such as “Fewer than 5” or “Less than 10%.”",
    "description": "Typically, a Storm Center outage map provides two kinds of layers for showing outage information. One kind of layer shows outage location icons for individual outages and cluster icons for groups of outages. The other kind of layer shows the number or the percentage of customers affected by outages by shading a geographical area such as a county, municipality, or postal code area.\nWhen creating an Additional Map Layer, refer to the Create Additional Map Layer page.",

    "content": "This page provides a list of terms and definitions related to the KUBRA Notifi product.\nTerm Definition Account A utility or organization account, identified by an account number supplied by the utility or other organization. There is typically one account per premises. Advanced Reporting An optional Notifi module that provides options for authorized admin users to create and share customizable charts and reports about customer activities. See the Notifi Advanced Reporting page for more information. Affirmation An informative message that tells the recipient that a contact has been successfully associated with an account. No action from the recipient is required in response to the message. Aggregated Message A message that is created and sent to a contact about one event or a set of similar events that affects multiple accounts for which the contact is registered and enrolled to receive messages. Aggregated Messaging A Notifi feature where the system combines multiple messages which are part of the same batch of events if they are directed to one contact. Messages are eligible for aggregation if they have the same event data (estimated restoration time, message text, etc.) but different account information (address, account number, etc.) and if there is an aggregated message template for the event type. See the Aggregated Messaging page for more information. Back-End Systems Refers to the systems Notifi integrates with, such as an Outage Management System, Customer Information System, Customer Relationship Management System, or Meter Data Management System. Blocklist A list containing invalid email addresses or other contacts. Blocklists are sometimes used to reject email messages at the server level before the message is delivered to an inbox. The opposite is an Allowlist. Broadcast A type of message created using the Notifi Broadcast tool, as opposed to a Transactional Message, which is triggered by an event or a customer message. In Notifi reporting, broadcast messages are grouped with proactive messages. Channel A method of communication, such as email, text message (SMS), voice message, push notification (Android/iOS), or smart speaker. Confirmation A message that requests a reply from the recipient to confirm the association of a contact with an account. This is used to confirm that the contact owner is aware of and approves the registration. Contact Individual contact information, such as a phone number or email address, used to receive messages on one channel. Notifi counts each channel as a separate contact. For example, if one phone number is used for both text messages and voice messages, Notifi counts this as two contacts: one contact for text messages and one contact for voice messages. Dashboard A set of charts and tables available to users of the Reports tool in the Notifi Management Console. Default and Supplemental Contacts A Notifi feature that allows a broadcast file upload or an event submission to include default contacts, supplemental contacts, or both as recipients for messages. See the Default and Supplemental Contacts page for more information. Default Contact A contact that is not registered in the Notifi preferences database that is used to send messages to a recipient if there are no registered contacts for an account, or if there are no enrollments for the message type being sent. Delivery Status The current state of a message sent from the Notifi system. See the History tool page for information about specific delivery status values. Eligibility The state of being qualified to receive a specific message type or message category. For example, an organization can decide that only accounts with smart meters are eligible to receive demand response messages. Enrollment The association of a contact with a message category. The enrollment also includes Do Not Disturb settings for the specific contact and message category. For example, a customer can request outage messages by SMS text and set a Do Not Disturb period of 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. A contact must have an active registration to create an enrollment. Event An action occurring in a back-end system that is of interest to customers and triggers a related message. For example, an update to the estimated restoration time for an outage is an event which can trigger an outage update message, and a customer statement being finalized for the month is an event which can trigger a statement ready message. Excessive Messaging A situation that leads to a contact receiving more messages than might be ideal from a customer experience perspective. If a Notifi implementation has Excessive Messaging Protection thresholds set, this situation can result in a contact being auto-paused for a set period of time. Individual Message A standard message sent to one contact about one event related to one account, as opposed to an aggregated message. Management Console The user interface for utility or organization administrators. Message A single transmission sent or received by Notifi, such as an email, text message, voice message, or push notification. Message Category (also called Program) A set of related message templates. The templates can be either proactive messages or content for an automated two-way conversation. For proactive alerts, a category is a set of message templates which are grouped together to allow a user to request to receive them as part of a single enrollment, such as Billing messages or Outage messages. For two-way conversations, the initial keyword or message from the user and all related responses from the Notifi system are a single message category. Message Group A set of proactive and two-way Message Categories related by topic, used for analytics. For example, outage messages and two-way outage reports and status requests are one message group, and billing \u0026 payment messages and two-way bill payment authorizations and balance requests are another message group. Message Template A combination of text and variables that Notifi uses to produce a message. There are separate message templates for each message type and each communication channel. For example, an “outage detected” text message template, an “outage reported” voice message template, or an “ETR update” email message template. Message Type A classification of messages by subject. For example, bill available, ETR updated, power restored, or payment successful. Messages Received Refers to incoming messages or messages originating from a customer. In SMS, this is also known as Mobile Originated or MO. Messages Sent Refers to messages originating in Notifi. In SMS, this is also known as Mobile Terminated or MT. Nickname A short name or text label applied by a customer to an account or contact. Opt-In The start of an enrollment, when a customer asks to receive messages. Opt-Out The end of an enrollment, when a customer asks to stop receiving messages. Opt-Out List A list containing contacts that have been opted out of receiving messages from Notifi. Both the contact and the message type for the opt-out are recorded, which means that a contact can be opted out of some message types while still receiving other message types from Notifi. Notifi checks default contacts and supplemental contacts against this list before sending messages. If a contact is on the opt-out list, Notifi will not send a message to that contact. Pause A Notifi feature where the system temporarily does not send messages to a contact, either because the contact owner requested a pause or due to detected excessive messaging. A pause implemented due to excessive messaging is also called an auto pause. Preferences The set of contacts, messaging settings, and enrollments associated with an account. Proactive Message A message sent from Notifi that is triggered by an event, as opposed to a message received from a customer or a message sent in response to a customer message. Push Notification A message sent to a specific mobile app. Registration The association of a confirmed contact with a valid account. For example, a registration is created when a customer adds an email address using the Notifi preference center UI. Pending registration Pending registrations happen when a contact owner has not completed the registration process. For example, if a customer has not completed the double opt-in process for SMS by responding to a confirmation message, the SMS contact’s registration will be considered pending. Registration Source The origin of a registration. Possible sources include website, initial load, text message, and mobile app. Not all Notifi implementations include all possible registration sources. Supplemental Contact A contact that is not registered in the Notifi preferences database that is used in addition to any registered contacts for the message type being sent. Two-Way Messaging SMS message conversations started by the customer using an SMS keyword (such as OUT, STAT, or BAL) or a natural language message that indicates a supported intent. The initial message from the customer and all related messages between the customer and Notifi for the same intent are considered part of a single message category.",

    "content": "Storm Center also allows you to display additional data like hazards, gas outages, flooding etc. on your public or internal Outage Maps using Additional Map Layers.\nTo create an Additional Map Layer, use the Data Layers sub-section of the Shared Resources section of the Instance Dashboard.\nWarning\rAdditional Map Layers can only be created once you have outage maps; they cannot exist in isolation.\nLayer Name, Source, and Titles Click the Create Data Layer button. Enter a name for the layer - this name is how you will identify the layer in other areas of the Instance Manager; it will not show up on the map. Select an access restriction policy. The options available in the drop-down come from the policies created in the Access Restriction section of the Instance Dashboard. Select a layer type. For an Additional Map Layer, select AML. “AML” is for showing non-outage data on a map layer. This layer type is only available with the Additional Map Layer module. Enter titles for the layer for each language supported by the instance - these titles will be used at the top of the information panels on the map. If you want to use the value of the specific property (such as the name) as the information panel title, enter ${name} in the layer title fields.. Enter a title for the information panels associated with individual icons and a title for the information panels associated with cluster icons. KUBRA recommends a maximum of 15-20 characters for these titles. You may need to adjust the length or formatting of the titles after testing them on a map to ensure that they display and wrap well. Select the type of layer you want the AML to be. Your choices are Client Cluster or Vector. Client Cluster - Allows for clustering to be done on your data. Allows both clustered icons and individual icons. Vector - Allows the map to display data as-is, no clustering Layer Data Source and Information Panel Fields Under Layer Sources, select the AML data you want to associate with the layer. Under Information Panel Fields, use the Add Data Fields button to define each data field included in the Additional Map Layer data feed. Information Panel Fields and Data Fields for Additional Map Layers AML GeoJSON files contain elements that you need to define for the layer. You can create data fields for an Additional Map Layer similar to how you currently create metadata fields for outage layers.\nDefine the element name indicated in the GeoJSON files Define the element path to the element in the data feed Input the Reduce function for this element. This is the operation/aggregation function you want to run on the AML data to display as a cluster Select the data type for the element from the drop-down. Options are string number datetime Note\rAggregation functions can only be run when the AML data type is string or number.\nNote\rElement names are case-sensitive. Ensure you think about case when naming elements.\nData Mapping for Additional Map Layers The Field Mappings selection of the data layer form associates data field mapping with one or more field types in the data layer. This allows the map to mask field values from an AML file with customer-friendly or public-facing values.\nIf you want to provide mapping for one or more data fields in the information panel for AML icons, click the Submit button at the bottom of the Create Data Layer form to save your in-progress layer and then follow the instructions to create data mapping.\nAfter you create the data mapping you want to use, return to the edit data layer form under Data Layers and click the Add Field Mapping Relationship button. Next, select a data field from the drop-down and then select the mapping name.\nAdditional Settings for Additional Map Layers Provide zoom settings and cluster tolerance. Enter a maximum zoom level at which to combine AML location icons into Clusters. Enter a zoom level at which to provide expanded AML information in the information panels for AML cluster icons - KUBRA recommends setting this zoom level one level below the Max Zoom to Cluster setting. If you do not want to show individual AML information in cluster icon information panels at any zoom level, set the Start Zoom to Paginate Outage to -1. Select a Cluster Tolerance Level on the slider between 20 and 40. Tip\rThe recommended Cluster Tolerance Level is based on the size of the AML location and cluster icons. If you are using the default WCAG-compliant icon set, KUBRA recommends setting the cluster tolerance to 35.\nRange Styles for Additional Map Layers You can customize how a Storm Center layer looks by writing a JSON object. For a map data layer, each JSON object consists of properties representing the ranges.\nStorm Center provides 3 choices to assist you in writing your JSON object.\nSelect a pre-existing template under Apply Styling Template, modify if needed OR Copy a template from another layer in the same instance, modify if needed OR Write your own JSON object. This table lists all the choices you have while writing or editing a range on a JSON object.\nJSON property Description Possible use cases legendOrder Decides the order of the defined range in the legend. A legend order of -1 will hide this range style from the legend. rangeExpr Decides range conditions. See Range Expressions for more details. rangeLabel Defines the range label for each range, appears to the right of the icon in the map legend. Each defined range should have range labels in all languages supported for that instance of Storm Center. KUBRA recommends a maximum of 25 characters for these labels. rangeStyles Defines the styles associated with a range. Since it is an object that contains the styles, all options under Range Styles will be included in the table with a dot notation. rangeStyles.shape Defines all the characteristics of a polygon shape. These characteristics exist when there is a shape to represent for AML polygons. rangeStyles.shape.borderColor Defines the polygon’s border color. Use Hex color codes. rangeStyles.shape.borderOpacity Defines the polygon’s border opacity. Accepts a decimal value between and including 0 and 1. rangeStyles.shape.borderWeight Defines the polygon’s border weight. Accepts an integer value equal to or greater than 0. rangeStyles.shape.fillColor Defines the polygon’s fill color. Use Hex color codes. rangeStyles.shape.opacity Defines the polygon’s opacity. Accepts a decimal value between and including 0 and 1. rangeStyles.icon Defines all the characteristics of the icon specific to that range. These characteristics exist when there is an icon to represent the AML location. rangeStyles.icon.url Defines the url for the icon. KUBRA requires using the path URL from Image Resource Manager for this purpose. rangeStyles.icon.size Defines the icon size. Provide a width and height in pixels for the icon. Input accepted is an array [width, height]. rangeStyles.icon.anchor Defines the icon anchor. The coordinates of the “tip” of the icon (relative to its top left corner). The icon will be aligned so that this point is at the marker’s geographical location. Input accepted is an array [x,y]. rangeStyles.icon.labelValue Displays a map label for that icon. Clients can request specific values they want the label to display. You can use properties of the record for the label value, for example ${n_out}, ${cust_a.val}. rangeStyles.icon.labelAnchor Defines the icon label anchor. The coordinates of the “tip” of the icon label (relative to its top left corner). The label will be aligned so that this point is at the marker’s geographical location. Input accepted is an array [x,y]. rangeStyles.icon.opacity Defines icon opacity. Accepts a decimal value between and including 0 and 1. Note\rWhen styling mapped data fields, the original data has a .orig added to it. You can use fieldName.orig in your Range Expressions to avoid adding translations when performing data mapping.\nRange Expressions A range expression is a JSON property which decides range definition conditions. Conditions are defined over data fields. Each data field supports specific operators depending on the data type of the field.\nNote\rRange expressions can include one or more conditions using the \u0026\u0026 (AND) and || (OR) operators.\nYou can use the following conditions to define a range:\nCondition JSON parameter Data type Special features Cluster cluster boolean Special field indicating if the map element corresponds to a cluster or not. Cause cause string, JSON object Supports mapping tables; view warning below when using mapping tables for Range Expressions. Number of customers affected cust_a.val integer To access the value of cust_a, use the cust_a.val parameter. Percentage of customers affected perc_cust_a.val integer To access the value of perc_cust_a, use the perc_cust_a.val parameter. Comments comments string No special features. Crew icon crew_icon boolean To determine whether the crew icon is shown for the AML location on the Storm Center map. If True, the crew icon will be shown. If False, the crew icon will not be shown. However, you still need to click the Enable Crew Indicator checkbox to confirm the icon will be visible. Crew status crew_status string, JSON object Supports mapping tables; view warning below when using mapping tables for Range Expressions. Metadata metadata JSON object, supports integer, string, boolean Elements within the Metadata property support mapping tables depending on the configuration; view warning below when using mapping tables for Range Expressions. Number of AML elements n_out integer No special features. When using mapping tables for a range expression, you should reference mapping table languages with square brackets like parameter['language']. The languages available are EN-US, ES-ES, es-US, and fr-CA. For example, accessing the cause in French would be cause['fr-CA']. Ideally, we recommend using the default language used when creating the instance when you reference a language in the mapping table.\nEnsure you have an additional condition defining the parameter as not equal to null (to avoid an error when parsing the expression).\nFor example, “cause != null”. “cause != null \u0026\u0026 cause[‘EN-US’] == ‘Planned maintenance’” is an example of a condition that supports mapping tables.\nThe table below indicates the operators allowed with data types used in Range Expressions.\nData type Operators allowed boolean OR, AND, ==, !=, unary operator (!a) string OR, AND, ===, ==, !==, !=, can use (\u003c, \u003e, \u003c=, \u003e=) operators when lexical and case dependent matching integer OR, AND, ===, ==, !==, !=, \u003c, \u003e, \u003c=, \u003e=, +, -, *, /, unary operators (+a, -a, !a) Note\rAML uses data fields specifically defined for it. Ensure you use those data fields while defining Range Expressions.\nKUBRA-recommended icons and color/shape combinations Note\rKUBRA recommends using a combination of color and shape for AML icons to help users with color vision deficiency. In addition, the colors for the recommended icons are selected to provide adequate contrast with the white color used for the icon shapes and with the background map.\nTip\rKUBRA recommends using the following image sizes (in pixels): 24x24 up to 32x32 SVGs for individual elements and 40x40 SVGs for element clusters, similar to the recommended icon sizes for outages and outage clusters.\nIcons for Additional Map Layers These are the default KUBRA-recommended ADA-compliant icons for an Additional Map layer:\nWater Outage Water Cluster Gas Outage Gas Cluster General Hazard Hazard Cluster Fire Road Closure General Water Gas Leak Legend Labels The map legend includes an introductory label to indicate what the numbers for each range refer to. For example, if you chose “Customers Affected” as the method for determining ranges, you could use “Customers Affected” as the Legend Label.\nEnter labels to be used on the map legend for each language supported by the instance. KUBRA recommends a maximum of 25 characters for the map legend labels.\nLayer Field Labels You can determine the order of the data fields shown in the information panel for the layer and provide labels for each field. Data fields are arranged vertically - the field with order 1 will be at the top of the information panel, followed by the field with order 2, and so on.\nChoose an order for each data field and enter labels for each language supported by the instance.

You will only see options in this list if there is a corresponding thematic file associated with your instance. Enter a label to be used for the summary report button in the overview panel. Enter a label for each language supported by the instance. KUBRA recommends that these labels be 10-15 characters. You may need to adjust the length or formatting of the label or labels after testing them on a map to ensure that they display and wrap well. Enter a title to be used at the top of the summary report for each language supported by the instance. KUBRA recommends that this title be no more than 30 characters. If you want to include a description at the top of the summary report, click the Submit button at the bottom of the create summary report form to save your in-progress report and then follow the instructions to create a configurable content block. After you create the content block you want to use, return to the edit summary report form under Summary Reports and select the content block name from the Summary Report Descriptions drop-down field. KUBRA recommends that this description be no more than 368 characters and only include text and links. Hyperlinks must use a complete URL including the protocol. For example, https://example.com. You can include click-to-call links for phone numbers in the header message using the link format tel:5555555555. This link format uses the 10-digit phone number, including area code but excluding country code. On mobile screen sizes, the report description opens at the bottom of the report when the user selects a Report Details button at the bottom of the report. Select one or more region files to use for the areas in the report. If you want to merge data from multiple regions, click the Merge Multiple Regions checkbox. If you have only one region file, this option is not applicable. Data Fields and Labels Select the data fields you want to include in the summary report. You can select a subset of the selected fields for desktop screen sizes to be shown on mobile screen sizes. The selected data fields will become columns on the summary report. For desktop, KUBRA recommends a maximum of six summary report columns, including the mandatory name column. For mobile, KUBRA recommends a maximum of four summary report columns, including the mandatory Name column. Field options are: Customers Served Customers Affected Percentage Customers Affected ETR - Estimated Restoration Time Number of Outages Enter field labels to be used for the report column headers for desktop and mobile browsers and for each language supported by the instance. Labels for mobile browsers should be shorter than labels for desktop browsers so they can be read on a narrow screen. KUBRA recommends a maximum of 26 characters for the desktop label and a maximum of 10 characters for the mobile label. You may need to adjust the length or formatting of the labels after testing them on a map to ensure that they display and wrap well. To change the order of the report columns, click the up or down arrows under “Order.” The order from top to bottom in the Summary Report form will become the order from left to right on the report. Note\rThe Name field will always be included as a column on the summary report. If the thematic type you selected for the report includes a hierarchy, you will also have the option to include the hierarchy name as a column on the report. For example, you can include a “State” column on a County report.\nTip\rYou cannot include a column on a summary report for mobile screen sizes if you do not show that column for desktop screen sizes.\nReport Behavior Settings If you want to include a filter field on the report that will allow users to find a specific area on the report by entering the name of the area, click the Filter by Area Name checkbox. If you have a report that includes a hierarchy (parent-child relationships) and want to have the report open with all child items visible when the report loads, click the Expand Tree on Load checkbox. If you do not want to limit the areas visible on the report for mobile browsers to areas with current outages, click the Display Areas without Outages on Mobile checkbox to set it to “on.” This checkbox is “off” by default. If you do not want to limit the areas visible on the report for desktop browsers to areas with current outages, click the Display Areas without Outages on Desktop checkbox to set it to “on.” This checkbox is “on” by default. If you want to include a button on the report that allows users to export a copy of the report data in CSV format, click the Allow summary report to be exported checkbox to set it to “on.” This checkbox is “off” by default. Use the Default Sort Field drop-down to select a data field to use for sorting the report. Options are “Name” and all of the data fields you selected to be included in the report. Use the Default Sort Order drop-down to select whether to sort data on the report in ascending (Asc) or descending (Desc) order based on the Default Sort Field. For example, you can choose to sort the report by area Name in ascending order (A to Z) or you can choose to sort the report by number of outages in descending order (most outages to fewest outages). If you want to create a tree format report that includes information based on a hierarchy of areas, use the drop-down lists under Tree Format Hierarchy to specify the starting and ending levels for the hierarchy. For example, selecting “State” as the starting hierarchy and “County” as the ending hierarchy will create a collapsible list of counties grouped by state. Summary Report Export If you include an Export Data button on a summary report, all users of a map that includes the summary report will see the Export Data button.\nWhen a user clicks the Export Data button, the CSV file will include whatever data is visible on the summary report at that time in whatever order is shown on the summary report at that time.\nFor example, if the user has applied an area filter and has sorted the report in ascending order by area name, only the areas included in the filtered view will be included in the CSV file, and they will be in alphabetical order by area name. The language in the CSV file will match the language currently selected on the Storm Center map.\nSummary report data files show each report row as a row in the CSV file. The first row of the CSV file includes the report column headers.\nFor Area columns with hierarchy, the CSV file will show headers based on the data file for the area. For example, a County summary report with a tree format hierarchy where State is the starting hierarchy and County Name is the ending hierarchy will show “County-1” as the header for the state names and “County-2” as the header for the county names.\nThe CSV file name will include the title of the summary report and the date and time of the Last Updated field on the summary report.\nETR Settings If you want to show expired estimated restoration time (ETR) values on the report, click the Mask Expired ETR checkbox to set it to “off.” This checkbox is “on” by default. You may want to set this checkbox to “off” if you are creating an internal-facing map and want to see all ETRs as reported from the source system for outage data, for example. Select an ETR Grouping Condition - options are “Latest ETR Any” and “Latest ETR All.” “Latest ETR Any” means that the map will display the latest ETR for outages in the area if any of the outages has a specific, valid ETR (not null or expired). If none of the outages in the area has a specific, valid ETR, the map will display the default message specified for null or expired ETRs in the Data Labels sub-section of the Shared Resources section. “Latest ETR All” means that the map will display the latest ETR for outages in the area only if all of the outages have a specific, valid ETR (not null or expired). If any of the outages in the area has a null or expired ETR, the map will display the default message for null or expired ETRs. Totals Settings If you want to show the total number of customers affected by active outages on the report, click the Total Customers Affected checkbox and enter a label to be used on the map for each language supported by the instance. If you want to show the total number of customers served on the report, click the Total Customers Served checkbox and enter a label to be used on the map for each language supported by the instance. Customer Masking If you want to mask the exact number of customers affected at or below a specific value, click the Customer Masking checkbox and then enter a number. If you want to mask the exact percentage of customers affected at or below a specific value, click the % Customer Masking checkbox and then enter a number. The values you enter for customer masking here will be combined with verbiage you enter in the Shared Resources section of the Create New View form to create a statement on the map such as “Fewer than 5” or “Less than 10%.”\nAccess Restriction Select an access restriction policy. The options available in the drop-down come from the policies created in the Access Restriction section of the Instance Dashboard.",

To add the option to the layer visibility configuration, click the Submit button. Repeat these steps for each option you want to add to the layer visibility configuration. After you have created all the options you want to include in the visibility configuration, you can change the order in which the options will appear in the map view selector. The numbers in the “Order” column on the Visibility Options screen from lowest to highest will be the order from top to bottom in the map view selector.\nAdd Layer Sub-Controls To edit sub-controls or add sub-controls to an option, click the Edit Sub-Controls button in the Visibility Options list or on the Edit Option form.\nTo add a new sub-control, click the Create New Sub-Control button. Enter a name for the sub-control - this name is how you will identify the sub-control in other areas of the Layer Visibility forms. Select the layer you want to include in the sub-control. Enter a minimum and maximum zoom level for the sub-control. To add the sub-control to the option, click the Submit button. Repeat these steps for each sub-control you want to add to the option. Note\rThe zoom level settings for the sub-controls on an option must be adjacent but not overlapping.\nSelect Default Options per Map Mode To add settings for the visibility options to be shown on page load for blue-sky mode and storm mode, return to the Visibility Configurations list and then click the Edit button to the right of the visibility configuration name.\nSelect which visibility option will be shown on page load for blue-sky mode. Select which visibility option will be shown on page load for storm mode. Blue-sky mode and storm mode are the two map modes you can change between in the Storm Center Settings app. Selecting a different visibility option for storm mode than for blue-sky mode in this section of the Instance Manager allows you to change what users see on the map on page load if you change the map mode from “blue-sky” to “storm” in the Storm Center Settings app.\nNote\rIf a map includes more than one visibility configuration, the storm mode setting will only work for the first visibility configuration in the list.\nConfiguration Examples You can use settings for visibility configurations, visibility options, and sub-controls to create multiple ways of presenting outage layers on a map. Some examples are discussed below.\nExamples 1-4 use a map with the following settings.\nSetting Value Minimum Zoom Level 5 Maximum Zoom Level 18 Starting Zoom Level 10 Layer 1 An outages layer called “Location” Layer 2 A thematic layer for ZIP Code Layer 3 A thematic layer for County Examples 5-8 use a map that also has a planned outages layer called “Planned.”\nExample 1 - One visibility option per layer with auto-switching between visibility options To create a map that provides separate map view choices for each layer and automatically switches from the county layer to the ZIP code layer to the outages layer as a user zooms in, follow these guidelines.\nAuto-switching between the map view choices is especially helpful for users on mobile devices, as it helps ensure that the user can always see useful information. Keeping separate visibility options for each layer allows users to select any of the choices at any zoom level.\nCreate three visibility options, one for each data layer: Location, ZIP Code, and County. Use the settings from the table below. Select the Location option as the default for blue-sky mode. Select the County option as the default for storm mode. Option/Sub-Control Layer Minimum Zoom Level Maximum Zoom Level Check Zoom In Check Zoom Out Location Outages - Location 13 18 No No ZIP Code Thematic - ZIP Code 9 12 Yes No County Thematic - County 5 8 Yes No The visibility options in the configuration will match the map view choices available in the map legend.\nThe configuration will create a map that looks like this.\nThe user can use the map view selector in the map legend to change between visibility options at any zoom level. Because the Location option is selected as the default for blue-sky mode, the map opens at zoom level 10 with the Location option selected. If an admin user changes the map from blue-sky mode to storm mode, the map will open at zoom level 10 with the County option selected.\nIf the user selects the County option, the map will show the County layer. If the user then zooms in, the map will change from the County option to the ZIP Code option when the user zooms in to any of the zoom levels in the range for the ZIP Code option. If the user continues to zoom in with the ZIP Code option selected, the map will change from the ZIP Code option to the Location option when the user zooms in to any of the zoom levels in the range for the Location option.\nIf the user zooms out with any of the three options selected, the map will not change from the selected option to one of the other options. In addition, the user can select a different option at any zoom level. The map view will change if the user zooms in and the new zoom level is in the range for a different option.\nExample 2 - One visibility option for outage locations layer and one visibility option for thematic layers with auto-switching between thematic sub-controls To create a map that provides two map view choices, one for outages by location and one for outages by area, and that automatically switches between the county layer and the ZIP code layer when the “outages by area” choice is selected and a user zooms in or out, follow these guidelines.\nCreate two visibility options: one for the outages layer (Locations option) and one for the two thematic layers (Areas option). Do not select a layer at the option level for the Areas option. Create two sub-controls for the Areas option: one for the County layer and one for the ZIP Code layer. Use the settings from the table below. Select the Locations option as the default for blue-sky mode. Select the Areas option as the default for storm mode. Option/Sub-Control Layer Minimum Zoom Level Maximum Zoom Level Check Zoom In Check Zoom Out Locations Outages - Location 13 18 No No Areas none 5 12 Yes No ZIP Code Thematic - ZIP Code 10 18 - - County Thematic - County 5 9 - - Note\rSub-Controls are considered to have the Check Zoom In and Check Zoom Out settings selected by default.\nThe visibility options in the configuration will match the map view choices available in the map legend.\nThe configuration will create a map that looks like this.\nThe user can use the map view selector in the map legend to change between visibility options at any zoom level. Because the Locations option is selected as the default for blue-sky mode, the map opens at zoom level 10 with the Locations option selected. If an admin user changes the map from blue-sky mode to storm mode, the map will open at zoom level 10 with the Areas option selected.\nIf the user selects the Areas option, the map will show either the County layer or the ZIP Code layer depending on the current zoom level. If the user zooms in with the Outages by Area choice selected, the map will change from the County layer to the ZIP Code layer when the user zooms in to any of the zoom levels in the range for the ZIP Code sub-control. If the user continues to zoom in, the map will change from the ZIP Code layer to the Location option when the user zooms in to any of the zoom levels in the range for the Location option.\nIf the user zooms out with the Outages by Area choice selected, the map will change from the ZIP Code layer to the County layer when the user zooms out to any of the zoom levels in the range for the County sub-control.\nExample 3 - One visibility option per layer with no auto-switching between layers To create a map that provides separate map view choices for each layer and does not automatically switch between layers when a user zooms in or out, follow these guidelines.\nCreate three visibility options, one for each data layer. Use the settings from the table below. Select the Location option as the default for blue-sky mode. Select the County option as the default for storm mode. Option/Sub-Control Layer Minimum Zoom Level Maximum Zoom Level Check Zoom In Check Zoom Out Location Outages - Location 5 18 No No ZIP Code Thematic - ZIP Code 5 18 No No County Thematic - County 5 18 No No The visibility options in the configuration will match the map view choices available in the map legend.\nThe configuration will create a map that looks like this.\nThe user can use the map view selector in the map legend to change between visibility options, and each visibility option is visible at all zoom levels supported by the map.\nExample 4 - One visibility option for all layers with auto-switching between sub-controls To create a map that does not include map view choices in the map legend and automatically switches between the layers when a user zooms in or out, follow these guidelines.\nCreate one visibility option with no layers selected at the option level. Create three sub-controls, one for each layer. Use the settings from the table below. Select the visibility option as the default for both blue-sky mode and storm mode. This means that changing the map mode in the Storm Center Settings app will not change the map UI. Option/Sub-Control Layer Minimum Zoom Level Maximum Zoom Level Check Zoom In Check Zoom Out Outages none 5 18 Yes Yes Location Outages - Location 14 18 - - ZIP Code Thematic - ZIP Code 11 13 - - County Thematic - County 5 10 - - The combination of the sub-control zoom level ranges should be the same as the overall zoom level range for the map, and the ranges of the sub-controls should be adjacent but not overlapping.\nBecause there is only one visibility option in the configuration and because layers are only connected at the sub-control level, there will not be any map view choices in the map legend.\nThe configuration will create a map that looks like this.\nThe user does not have a choice to change between the layers in the map legend. The County sub-control is visible at the minimum zoom level supported by the map, and this view changes to the ZIP Code sub-control when the user zooms in to any of the zoom levels in the range for the ZIP Code sub-control, and then to the Location sub-control when the user zooms in to any of the zoom levels in the range for the Location sub-control.\nExample 5 - One visibility configuration for active outage layers and one visibility configuration for planned outages in list format To create a map that shows a list of radio buttons for active outages and planned outages always visible on the map legend and includes a map view selector to view active outages by location or by area when the active outages choice is selected, follow these guidelines.\nCreate one visibility configuration called Active-Outages with one visibility option for the location layer and one visibility option with sub-controls for the county and ZIP code layers. Use the settings from the table below for this Active Outages visibility configuration. Select the Locations visibility option as the default for blue-sky mode and the Areas visibility option as the default for storm mode. Option/Sub-Control Layer Minimum Zoom Level Maximum Zoom Level Check Zoom In Check Zoom Out Locations Outages - Location 13 18 No No Areas none 5 12 Yes No ZIP Code Thematic - ZIP Code 10 18 - - County Thematic - County 5 9 - - Create a second visibility configuration with one visibility option for the planned outages layer. Use the settings from the table below for this Planned Outages visibility configuration. Select the Planned Outages visibility option as the default for both blue-sky and storm mode for the planned outage visibility configuration. Option/Sub-Control Layer Minimum Zoom Level Maximum Zoom Level Check Zoom In Check Zoom Out Planned Outages Planned 5 18 No No Select both the Active-Outages visibility configuration and the Planned-Outages visibility configuration under Shared Resources in the Create Map View form. The order in which you select the visibility configurations is the order in which they will appear in the map legend. Select the “Show Legend as List” option under Widgets in the Create Map View form. The visibility configurations in the map view configuration will match the radio button map view choices available in the map legend, and the visibility options in the active outages configuration will match the drop-down map view choices available in the map legend.\nThe configuration will create a map that looks like this.\nThe user can use the radio buttons above the map view selector in the map legend to choose to view either Active Outages or Planned Outages.\nIf the user selects the Active Outages radio button, the user can use the map view selector to change between Locations and Areas at any zoom level. While the Areas choice is selected, the map will change from showing Counties to showing ZIP Codes if the user zooms in to a zoom level in the range for the ZIP Codes sub-control.\nIf the user selects the Planned Outages radio button, the map will show cluster icons and individual outage icons for planned outages at all zoom levels.\nIf an admin user puts the map into Storm Mode using the Settings app, the selector under Active Outages will show Areas on page load instead of Locations. The Storm Mode setting will not have any effect on the Planned Outages map view choice.\nExample 6 - One visibility configuration for planned outages and one visibility configuration for active outage layers in menu format To create a map that shows a map view selector at the top of the map legend that includes radio buttons for planned outages and active outages and choices to view active outages by location or by area when the active outages radio button is selected, follow these guidelines.\nCreate one visibility configuration with one visibility option for the planned outages layer. Use the settings from the table below for this Planned Outages visibility configuration. Select the planned outages visibility option as the default for both blue-sky and storm mode for the planned outage visibility configuration. Option/Sub-Control Layer Minimum Zoom Level Maximum Zoom Level Check Zoom In Check Zoom Out Planned Outages Planned 5 18 No No Create a second visibility configuration called Active-Outages with one visibility option for the location layer and one visibility option with sub-controls for the county and ZIP code layers. Use the settings from the table below for this Active Outages visibility configuration. Select the Locations visibility option as the default for blue-sky mode and the Areas visibility option as the default for storm mode. Option/Sub-Control Layer Minimum Zoom Level Maximum Zoom Level Check Zoom In Check Zoom Out Locations Outages - Location 13 18 No No Areas none 5 12 Yes No ZIP Code Thematic - ZIP Code 10 18 - - County Thematic - County 5 9 - - Select both the Planned-Outages visibility configuration and the Active-Outages visibility configuration under Shared Resources in the Create Map View form. Leave the “Show Legend as List” option unselected under Widgets in the Create Map View form. The visibility configurations in the map view configuration will match the radio button map view choices available in the map view selector, and the visibility options in the active outages configuration will match the drop-down list map view choices available in the map view selector.\nThe configuration will create a map that looks like this.\nThe user can open the map view selector at the top of the map legend to see two radio buttons, one for Planned Outages and one for Active Outages. While the Active Outages radio button is selected, the user can also use a list of choices to change between viewing active outages by location and viewing active outages by area. The user can change between Locations and Areas at any zoom level. While the Areas option is selected, the map will change from showing Counties to showing ZIP Codes if the user zooms in to a zoom level in the range for the ZIP Codes sub-control.\nIf the user selects the Planned Outages radio button, the map will show cluster icons and individual outage icons for planned outages at all zoom levels.\nIf an admin user puts the map into Storm Mode using the Settings app, the Storm Mode setting will not have any effect because the Planned Outages configuration appears first and does not have multiple visibility options.\nExample 7 - Separate visibility options for active outages and planned outages To create a map that shows separate map view choices for active outages and planned outages as a list in the map view selector in the map legend, follow these guidelines. This is similar to the setup in example 3, except with active outages and planned outages layers instead of multiple active outages layers.\nCreate one visibility option for Active Outages with an Outages layer, and one visibility option for Planned Outages with a Planned layer. Use the settings from the table below. Select the Planned Outages visibility option as the default for blue-sky mode. Select the Active Outages visibility option as the default for storm mode. Option/Sub-Control Layer Minimum Zoom Level Maximum Zoom Level Check Zoom In Check Zoom Out Active Outages Outages - Locations 5 18 No No Planned Outages Planned 5 18 No No The visibility options in the configuration will match the map view choices available in the map legend.\nThe configuration will create a map that looks like this.\nThe user can open the map view selector at the top of the map legend to change between viewing active outages and viewing planned outages. For this example, the outage icons and cluster icons are visible at all zoom levels.\nIf an admin user puts the map into Storm Mode using the Settings app, the map view selector will show Active Outages on page load instead of Planned Outages.\nExample 8 - Separate visibility configurations for active outage locations and planned outage locations To create a map that shows separate map view choices for active outages and planned outages as radio buttons on the map legend, follow these guidelines.\nCreate one visibility configuration for Active Outages with one visibility option for the Outages - Locations layer. Use the settings from the table below. Select the Active Outages visibility option as the default for both blue-sky mode and storm mode. Option/Sub-Control Layer Minimum Zoom Level Maximum Zoom Level Check Zoom In Check Zoom Out Active Outages Outages - Locations 5 18 No No Create a second visibility configuration for Planned Outages with one visibility option for the Planned Outages layer. Use the settings from the table below. Select the Planned Outages visibility option as the default for both blue-sky mode and storm mode. Option/Sub-Control Layer Minimum Zoom Level Maximum Zoom Level Check Zoom In Check Zoom Out Planned Outages Planned 5 18 No No The visibility configurations in the map view configuration will match the radio button map view choices available in the map legend.\nThe configuration will create a map that looks like this.\nThe user can select a radio button on the map legend to change between viewing active outages and viewing planned outages. For this example, the outage icons and cluster icons are visible at all zoom levels.\nBecause there is only one visibility option for each visibility configuration, the Storm Mode setting in the Settings app will have no effect on the map.",

For example, employees may need access to more information than customers.\nTo create a new map view, click the Create New View button on the Instance Dashboard.\nGeneral Information Use the General section of the Create New View form to identify the map.\nEnter a name for the map/view - this is how you will identify the map in other areas of the Instance Manager. Select a default language for the map from the drop-down - options are determined by the languages selected for the instance. If you want to have the map language change to match the user’s browser preferences when possible, select the Use User Locale? checkbox. Select a time zone for the map from the drop-down. Select a country for the map from the drop-down - currently, options are U.S. and Canada. This setting is used to restrict address search results to avoid presenting irrelevant locations to users of the map. If you want to use Google Analytics Universal (GAU) to track activity on the map, you can provide up to three GAU tracking codes. If you want to use more than one GAU account, you can enter multiple tracking codes. KUBRA has two tracking codes entered by default that cannot be changed, but does not provide individual organizations with access to these tracking codes. For more information about Storm Center analytics, see the Google Analytics Universal page. If you want to use Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to track activity on the map, you can provide up to three GA4 measurement IDs. If you want to use more than one GA4 account, you can enter multiple measurement IDs. KUBRA has a two measurement IDs entered by default that cannot be changed, but does not provide individual organizations with access to this measurement ID. For more information about Storm Center analytics, see the Google Analytics 4 page. If you are implementing a full-screen map web page and using a CNAME record for the web page URL, enter a page title for all languages supported by the map and provide a path URL for the favicon image you want to use. A path URL is generated when you use Image Resource Manager to upload your favicon. The page title and favicon appear in the browser tab when a user opens the map web page. Set an access restriction policy for the map. The options in this drop-down are created in the Access Restriction section of the instance dashboard. Time Zone Outage maps include times that indicate when the information on the map was last updated, when an outage started, and when an outage is estimated to be restored. To ensure these times are presented consistently, you can select either a set time zone for the map, such as Eastern or Mountain, or the “User Locale.” If you select “User Locale” as the time zone for the map, Storm Center will adjust times on the map to match the locale setting from each user’s web browser.\nMap Configuration Use the Map section of the Create New View form to select settings related to the background map.\nSelect a map API to use for the background map - currently, the only option is Google Maps. Provide API credentials. KUBRA’s Google Maps API credentials are entered by default. If you have a different license for Google Maps that you want to use, enter that license’s API credentials. Select the background map types you want to allow for the map from the drop-down - options are Road, Satellite, and Hybrid (satellite with roads and landmarks labeled). The options you select will be available to users of the map as a selector in the lower right corner of the map for changing the background map. Select a background map type to use when the map page loads. This is the Start Type. Zoom Level Settings Zoom levels are provided by the Google Maps API as integers between 0 and 21, where 0 shows the entire world and 21 shows streets and individual buildings. You can read more about how zoom levels work in the Google Maps API developer documentation External link opens in new tab\r. Storm Center allows you to set minimum and maximum zoom levels and to specify the starting zoom level used when the map page loads.\nEnter a minimum zoom level for the map - this is the lowest integer zoom level that users will be able to access. Users who attempt to zoom the map out further than the minimum zoom level will be returned to a view that uses the minimum zoom level. Enter a maximum zoom level for the map - this is the highest integer zoom level that users will be able to access. Users who attempt to zoom the map in closer than the maximum zoom level will be returned to a view that uses the maximum zoom level. Select a starting zoom level for the map - the drop-down for this setting includes options for all integers between and including the minimum zoom level and the maximum zoom level. Note\rThe zoom level settings you input here should match the zoom levels for the layer visibility configuration or configurations you will use for the map.\nLatitude and Longitude Settings (Map Boundaries) The Coordinates Input setting asks you to provide a latitude and longitude on which to center the map when the map page loads.\nThe Bounding Box setting asks you to provide latitude and longitude information for the external map boundaries. These values create an invisible box beyond which users are not allowed to navigate on the map. Users who attempt to navigate outside of this box will be returned to a view that is inside the bounding box.\nShared Resources Use the Shared Resources section of the Create New View form to select items from the Shared Resources connected to the Storm Center instance to include on the map.\nSelect the layer visibility configuration or configurations you want to use to provide options in the map legend. Before you can see layer visibility configurations here, you must configure layer visibility settings. Select the labeling you want to use for null and expired estimated restoration times (ETRs) and, if you are using the optional Planned Outages module, end times. Before you can select a labeling here, you must create data labels. Select a set of summary information to use at the top of the overview panel. Before you can select a summary here, you must create summaries. Select the outage summary report or reports you want to include in the overview panel. Before you can select outage summary reports here, you must create summary reports. Select the design to use for the map interface. Before you can select a design here, you must create a design. Provide verbiage to use for masking the number of customers affected by outages when it is below the value you set for a layer, summary, or summary report. For example, “Fewer than.” Storm Center does not add any characters between the end of the masking verbiage and the start of the masking value, so if you want the full phrase to read as “Fewer than 20,” you must add a space character at the end of the masking verbiage. Provide verbiage to use for masking the percentage of customers affected by outages when it is below the value you set for a layer, summary, or summary report. This field behaves the same way as the masking verbiage for number of customers affected. Note\rMasking verbiage is mandatory for number of customers affected, percentage of customers affected, or both if you have selected any masking settings for those data types in other areas of the Instance Dashboard. If you have not selected any masking settings, you do not need to provide masking verbiage here.\nWidgets Use the Widgets section of the Create New View form to include Custom Layers and Service Territory boundary information on the map, to select settings for the Weather radar layer if you included Weather in the map design you selected for the map, and to show the map view selector in the map legend as either a menu or a list.\nIf you want to make Custom Layers items available to users of the map, click the Enable Custom Layers for View? checkbox. If you want to show Custom Layers items when the map loads, click the Show View by Default on Map Load? checkbox. If you want to make weather radar available to users of the map, you must select Weather in the map interface design for the overview panel. If you want to show weather radar when the map loads, click the Show View by Default on Map Load? checkbox. Use the slider to select a default opacity percentage for the weather radar layer, between 0 (invisible) and 100 (fully opaque). Select a Service Territory indicator to use for the map. Before you can select a service territory here, you must create a service territory. If you have multiple visibility configurations connected to the map and want to show them as a list in the map legend above the map view selector menu, click the Show Legend as List checkbox. If you leave this checkbox unselected, the radio buttons for multiple visibility configurations will appear inside the map view selector menu. Example of visibility configurations shown as a list - checkbox selected Example of visibility configurations shown as a menu - checkbox not selected Clone a Map After you have created a map view, you can click the Clone View button to create a second map that copies all data from the original map. This can be helpful if you want to make a new map with only a few changes from an existing map’s configuration.\nYou can only clone a map view within the same instance. After you create or clone a map, you must deploy the instance to activate the new map URL.\nDeploy a Map To deploy the map or maps you have configured, use the Deploy Manager section of the Instance Dashboard. Click the Deploy sub-section of the Deploy Manager, and then click the Deploy! button.\nThe Instance Manager will provide a status message for the deployment. If the deployment is successful, the Instance Manager will provide a URL for each map associated with the instance. You can see the map URLs in the Manage My Views section on the instance dashboard.\nNote\rYou will not see outage data on the map until after you submit a delivery node file and an outage file using the feeds you configured for the map.\nEach time you update the configuration, you must re-deploy the map. After the first deployment, each new deployment of the same map will use the same URL.\nYou can also use the Deploy Manager section of the Instance Manager to verify your instance, review the current status of your deployed instance and data feeds, and see the deployment history for your instance and for the outage and delivery node files associated with the instance.",

    "content": "There are three options for embedding a Storm Center map into your website. The first option is to provide KUBRA with an SSL certificate for the CNAME record you want to use for the URL for a full-screen web page with a Storm Center map. The second option is to use an iframe on a web page you create as part of your website. The third option is to use a div element on a web page you create as part of your website.\nFor all embedded maps, the Google logo in the lower left corner of the map must be visible. This is a requirement for using Google Maps. One suggestion is to make sure embedded maps are at least 500px high.\nResponsive Layout Breakpoint Header buttons and social media links move from the map header to the overview panel when the iframe, div element, or browser window width is too narrow to fit the configured header content. This happens when the width is less than 768px.\nFull-Screen Map Web Page using a CNAME Certificate Note\rThe CNAME option is currently only available for public Storm Center maps, that is, maps that do not use password-protection or a firewall to restrict access to the map URL.\nTo specify the URL for a full-screen Storm Center map web page, you must provide KUBRA with an SSL certificate for the CNAME record of the URL you want to use. KUBRA will use this certificate to create a CloudFront instance, which links the map view URL to the desired domain. KUBRA will then provide the resulting CloudFront address.\nYou must set up your Domain Name System (DNS) to direct users attempting to access the map URL to the CloudFront address. You must also provide KUBRA with updated SSL certificates for the CNAME record to avoid issues with certificate expiration.\nNote\rIf you set up a CNAME for a Storm Center map and also want to embed the map in a different web page or other application, the full-screen map web page and the iframe or div element for the embedded map must use the same URL.\nAfter you set up a map to use a CNAME, you should only access that map using the CNAME URL. If you do access the map using the kubra.io URL, you should clear your browser cache before you use the CNAME URL to access the map.\nFull-Screen or Partial-Screen Map using an iframe Storm Center maps are designed to scale to fit the iframe where they are loaded. To maintain the responsive design of the map, the page containing the iframe also needs to use responsive design.\nThe following is example HTML that can be used to create a web page with no content outside of the iframe. To use this example, replace YOUR PAGE TITLE HERE with the page title you want to use, and replace YOUR_VIEW_ID with the map URL generated by the Instance Manager. If you set up a CNAME for a Storm Center map and also want to include that map in an iframe, use the CNAME URL instead of the URL generated by the Instance Manager.\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\r\u003chtml\u003e\r\u003chead\u003e\r\u003ctitle\u003eYOUR PAGE TITLE HERE\u003c/title\u003e\r\u003cmeta charset=\"UTF-8\"\u003e\r\u003cmeta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1\"\u003e\r\u003cstyle type=\"text/css\"\u003e\rbody {\rmargin: 0;\roverflow: hidden;\r}\riframe {\rposition: absolute;\rtop: 0px;\rleft: 0px;\rwidth: 100%;\rheight: 100%;\rborder: none;\r}\r\u003c/style\u003e\r\u003c/head\u003e\r\u003cbody\u003e\r\u003ciframe src=\"YOUR_VIEW_ID\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\r\u003c/body\u003e\r\u003c/html\u003e\rNote\rDo NOT use a meta tag for compatibility such as \u003cmeta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=10\"\u003e.

If you cannot see the Area Manager app, it may be because your organization does not have the Storm Center Area Manager module.\nThe Area Manager app screen includes a drop-down list for selecting one of the thematics associated with the instance, an option to provide an overwritten value for estimated restoration times (ETRs) for all areas in the thematic, and a table with a list of area names included in the currently selected thematic.\nFor example, if you have a “County” thematic, the Area Manager app will show a list of county names below the drop-down when you select the “County” thematic. The table of area names also includes columns for data from your outage data feed and for entering overwritten values to replace the values from the outage feed.\nNote\rThe Area Manager app shows all dates and times in the user’s browser time zone. When times are published to a map view, they are converted to the time zone configured for the map view.\nProvide a Global Overwritten ETR If your Area Manager app is configured to allow overwritten values for Estimated Restoration Time, you can click on the Overwrite All ETRs button to provide a “global” overwritten ETR. A selector will open that allows you to choose a date and time value or to select a predefined text value for the ETR you want to show on the map. Setting an overwritten ETR in this selector will apply the overwritten ETR to all areas in the currently selected thematic.\nEnter Overwritten ETR Values by Area If your Area Manager app is configured to allow overwritten values for Estimated Restoration Time, you can click on the text in the “Overwritten” column to the right of the “ETR” column for an area to enter an overwritten value. A selector will open that allows you to choose a date and time value or to select a predefined text value for the Estimated Restoration Time you want to show on the map for that area.\nIf the selected thematic includes an area hierarchy, you can apply an overwritten ETR value to the largest area in the hierarchy and then use the menu next to the overwritten value to apply the same value to all of the sub-areas in that hierarchy. For example, if you have a county thematic that includes a state hierarchy, you can choose to apply an overwritten ETR to at the state level and also apply the overwritten ETR to all of the counties in that state.\nYou can also use the menu next to an overwritten ETR value for the largest area in the hierarchy to clear overwritten values from all of the sub-areas in that hierarchy.\nEnter Overwritten Customers Affected Values by Area If your Area Manager app is configured to allow overwritten values for Customers Affected, you can click on the text in the “Overwritten” column to the right of the “Affected” column for an area to enter an overwritten value. A text field will open that allows you to type in the number of Customers Affected you want to show on the map for that area.\nNote\rYou cannot enter an overwritten value for Customers Affected that is higher than the number of customers served for that area. To help you keep track of this value, the Area Manager tool includes a “Served” column which shows the number of customers served for each area in the list.\nPublish Overwritten Data When you have finished entering all the overwritten values you want, click the Deploy button to save the overwritten values and show them on the map or maps for the instance.\nThe app will show a message whenever there are undeployed changes. This message disappears when you click the Deploy button.\nOverride Total Customers Affected and Total Outages fields Area Manager allows you to override the Total Customers Affected and Total Outages fields with values that are more accurate than the OMS values in the outage feed.\nYou can input your preferred values in these fields to have complete control over outage and customer data for each region. Area Manager has built-in checks to ensure these values align with the Customers Served values.\nEnsure you click Deploy to deploy the overridden values.\nYou can also implement these overrides through API calls.",

To deploy the instance, click the Deploy! button.\nThe status will change to “Deploying…” and then to “Successfully Deployed” if the deployment is started successfully.\nAfter the deployment starts, a delivery node file and an outage file must be successfully processed before the maps connected to the instance will show the configuration updates included in the deployment.\nVerify Instance Tool To access the verify instance tool and verify the status of the currently saved configurations for an instance, including any changes made since the last successful deployment, click the Verify Instance button on the Deploy Manager dashboard.\nThe verify instance tool shows the instance name, the request status for the verification, and the status of the verification. If there is not a verification request in process, the request status will either show the status of the previous request or it will be blank. To request a new verification, click the Verify! button.\nThe request status will change to “In Progress” and then to “Done.” When the request status is “Done,” the “Verified” status message shows the state of the verification, such as “Passed.”\nCurrent Status Tool To access the current status tool and view the current deployment status of an instance, click the Current Status button on the Deploy Manager dashboard.\nThe current status tool shows the instance name, the current deployment status of the instance, the last successful delivery node file processing date/time, and the last successful outage file processing date/time.\nIf the instance is currently deployed, the status will be “Active.”\nIf the instance is being deployed, the status will indicate which step of the process the instance is on: “Deployment in Pending State,” “Pending Delivery Node,” or “Pending Outage.”\nDeployment Process The deployment process is\nUser requests deployment. Configuration changes are applied from Instance Manager to the instance. The most recently submitted delivery node file is processed. The most recently submitted outage file is processed. The most recently submitted planned outage file (if any) is processed. The results of the delivery node, outage, and planned outage file processing are used to update the data on the map. The currently deployed map views (if any) are replaced with the results of the updated configuration and data file processing. The current status information does not update automatically while you are viewing the current status tool. To update the status information, click the Refresh button.\nDeployment History Tool To access the deployment history tool and view the list of deployments and file processing jobs for an instance, click the Deployment History button on the Deploy Manager dashboard.\nThe deployment history tool shows a list of deployments for an instance in reverse chronological order (from most recent to oldest).

    "content": "To access the Custom Layers app, click the Custom Layers button on the Control Center Dashboard under “Apps.”\nYou can use the Custom Layers app to add, edit, view, and delete ad hoc information items on the Storm Center outage map to communicate additional information to customers or other map users. The categories of information you can communicate are determined by the Information Area and Information Point categories set in the Custom Layers Admin tool.\nAn Information Area is a shape you can draw on the map that is shaded with a specified color. You can use information areas to provide information about a geographical area.\nAn Information Point is an icon you can add to the map that has a specified image. You can use information points to provide information about a specific location.\nView Information Area or Information Point Data First, decide whether you want to work with an Information Area or an Information Point. To open a list of existing Information Area or Information Point items, select the corresponding option from the Select a Layer Type drop-down menu.\nAfter you choose the layer type you want to work with, you can add an item of that type to the map using the item editor. To open the item editor, click the green plus sign button below the filter and at the upper right of the list of information areas or information points.\nFor both Information Areas and Information Points, there are five parameters you can add using the item editor. You can use some or all of these parameters.\nThe item parameters are:\nCreate Point/Area: This defines the placement of the item on the Storm Center map, and differs depending on the layer type. For an Information Area, you must mark the area boundaries on the map. For an Information Point, you must select a location for the icon on the map. Name: This identifies the item in the list of all items (Areas or Points). The Name will also be shown in the information panel for the item on the Storm Center map. If the name field is left empty, the information panel for the item will not show a name. There are separate Name fields for each language supported by the instance. Layer Type: This defines the appearance of the item to be added to the map. The item type differs depending on the layer type. For an Information Area, the Type determines the color of the shaded area on the map. For an Information Point, the Type determines the image or icon on the map. The information panel for the item on the Storm Center map will show a label for the item type that matches the title for the category set up in the Custom Layers Admin tool. Notes: This is a formatted content block that will be shown in the information panel for the item on the Storm Center map. You can insert hyperlinks, hypertext, or images in this field. Visible: This is a checkbox to make the object visible or not visible on the Storm Center map. Items are visible by default. Add a New Item To add a new Information Area or Information Point to the map, select the layer type from the Select a Layer Type drop-down and then click the green plus sign button.\nNavigate or search on the map to the location where you want to place the Information Area or Information Point and then click the Create button under Create Point/Area. When you move your mouse cursor over the map, it will change to a cross shape.\nTo place an Information Area, click on a corner of the shape you want to create, and then move the mouse cursor and click on each additional corner of the shape. To complete the shape, click again on the first corner you placed on the map.\nTo adjust the borders of the shape, click the Edit button under Create Point/Area. This will add dots to the shape on the map that you can click and drag to adjust the shape as needed.\nTo place an Information Point, click on the map where you want to put the Information Point icon.\nTo move the icon, click the Edit button under Create Point/Area. This will change the icon on the map to an icon of a flag that you can click and drag to any location on the map.\nTo save the shape or icon location when you have finished adjusting it, click the Done Editing button. To discard your changes, click the Cancel Edit button.\nEnter a name, select a layer type, and add any notes related to the Information Area or Information Point. The layer type drop-down shows a preview of the area color or icon shape while it is open.\nNote\rThe Custom Layers tool supports a maximum file size of 8MB per custom layers item. KUBRA recommends using no more than 2,000 words or approximately 8,700 text characters, and no more than six total image files in the notes for a single custom layers item.\nTo save the Information Area or Information Point and make it visible on the map, click the Visible checkbox and then click the Apply button.\nTo save the Information Area or Information Point without making it visible on the map, leave the Visible checkbox unselected and then click the Apply button. You may want to do this if you are pre-configuring custom layers items to be shown later, such as during a storm.\nThe next time you select the Information Area or Information Point list, the item you created will be visible on the preview map on the right side of the Custom Layers tool, and you will see a note that says “Changes Not Yet Deployed.”\nTo deploy your changes to the map or maps for the instance, click the Deploy button.\nEdit an Item To edit an existing Information Area or Information Point, select the layer type from the Select a Layer Type drop-down and then click on the row for the Information Area or Information Point you want to edit. The list includes a filter feature that allows you to filter the list by item type, whether the item is visible or not, item name, or item notes.\nAfter you click on a specific Information Area or Information Point in the list, the item editor will open and allow you to:\nChange whether the item is visible on the map Edit the item’s name Change the item’s layer type Adjust the borders of the information area shape or the location of the information point icon Edit any associated notes To quickly open the preview map at the location of the item, click the Go To button under Create Point/Area.\nTo save your changes and return to the list of items, click the Save button. To discard your changes, click the Cancel button.\nWhenever you save changes to an Information Area or Information Point, the changes will not be deployed to the map or maps for the instance until you click the Deploy button.\nRemove an Item To remove an Information Area or Information Point from the map, select the layer type from the Select a Layer Type drop-down and then click on the row for the Information Area or Information Point you want to remove. The list includes a filter feature that allows you to filter the list by item type, whether the item is visible or not, item name, or item notes.\nAfter you click on a specific information item, the item editor will open. To delete the item, click the Delete button at the bottom of the item editor. To confirm that you want to delete the item, click OK in the confirmation window. To cancel and keep the item, click the Cancel button.\nBulk Import Items The Custom Layers app allows you to import information for multiple Information Area items or multiple Information Point items using an Excel Strict Open XML Spreadsheet (.xlsx).\nTo import a new file with Custom Layers data:\nCreate a new Information Area file or Information Point file following the format described below. You can use the Export button to download a template with the correct headings. Select Information Areas or Information Points from the “Select a layer type” drop-down in the Custom Layers app. Select the option that matches the layer type of the file you created. Click the Import button. Drag and drop the file from your desktop into the upload area or click the Browse Computer button to locate the file and then select “Open.” Note\rWhen you import a new file, all existing items of the selected type (either information area or information point) will be replaced by the data in the file. If you upload a file that includes only a header line, all existing items of the selected type will be removed.\nCustom Layers Import File Format The maximum supported file size for custom layers import is 1 GB. Custom layers import supports a maximum of 1000 custom layers items per file.\nA file must include either Information Areas or Information Points, not a mix. The file must include at least one empty row to indicate the end of the list of custom layers items.\nAttribute Required? Description Type Yes String - defines the appearance of the item to be added to the map. The string must match one of the Name values defined in the Custom Layers Admin tool. You can see the Name values in the Layer Type drop-down field when you create or edit an item in the Custom Layers app. Type values are case-sensitive. Visible Yes Boolean - indicates whether to show the item on the Storm Center map. If true, the item will be visible. If false, the item will not be visible on the Storm Center map. Geometry No String - a set of coordinates representing the area for the Information Area or the location for the Information Point icon, in WKT External link opens in new tab\rformat. Information Area files will accept the LineString, Polygon, or MultiPolygon types. Information Point files will only accept the Point type. Name (one column for each supported language: “Name en-US,” “Name es-ES,” or “Name fr-CA”) No String - a name to identify the item in the Custom Layers app and at the top of the information panel for the item on the Storm Center map. If you do not provide a name for an item, the header of the information panel on the Storm Center map will be blank. Notes (one column for each supported language: “Notes en-US,” “Notes es-ES,” or “Notes fr-CA”) No String - notes related to the item that will appear in the information panel for the item on the Storm Center map. Notes can be either plain text or html formatted. For example, bold text in this field must be indicated with HTML tags such as \u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e. If you do not include a Geometry attribute for one or more custom layers items, you must add the geometry in the Custom Layers app before the item can be shown on the Storm Center map.\nNote\rImages are not supported in the Notes attribute for Custom Layers import files.\nGeographic Coordinate System for Geometry Elements Information Area files and Information Point files can include a geometry attribute in Well-known text (WKT) External link opens in new tab\rformat. Of the geometric objects supported by WKT, information areas will accept LineString, Polygon, and MultiPolygon, and information points will accept only Point.\nCoordinate pairs must be presented with the longitude followed by the latitude. The coordinate points of each geometry element must be provided in EPSG:4326, also known as WGS84. There is currently no support for providing coordinates in other geographic projection systems. For details about the EPSG:4326 coordinate system, access the specification provided by Spatial Reference External link opens in new tab\r.\nThe Open Geospatial Consortium standard for WKT requires a polygon to be topologically closed. If the exterior linear ring of a polygon is defined in a counter clockwise direction, it will be seen from the “top.”\nBulk Export Items Custom Layers allows you to export data for all currently entered Information Areas or Information Points in Excel Strict Open XML Spreadsheet (.xlsx) format.\nTo bulk export data:\nSelect Information Areas or Information Points from the “Select a layer type” drop-down in the Custom Layers app. Click the Export button. An exported file of Information Areas will be called informationareas.xlsx. An exported file of Information Points will be called informationpoints.xlsx.\nNote\rImages are not supported in the Notes attribute for Custom Layers export files.

    "content": "Introduction Map History is an optional module for Storm Center. Enabling this module allows an organization to keep up to five years of historical data processed by Storm Center. The Map History module also includes a Map History Viewer tool, where authorized users can select a time period from the five-year data retention window and view the selected data on an interactive map. Authorized users can also bookmark a specific date and time from the data retention window for future reference.\nNote\rBookmarks are deleted when they pass out of the five-year data retention window.\nThe Map History module combines data from all maps associated with the organization’s instance into one map view. The data shown in the Map History Viewer is based on the data files used by the Storm Center maps and some Control Center settings, along with configurations made in the Map History app.\nMap History Viewer To access the Map History Viewer:\nNavigate to the Instance Manager website. Sign in using Google or other single sign-on credentials. Choose a tenant - this option is only presented if you have access to more than one tenant. Choose the Map History application. Choose a Storm Center instance. View Historical Data You can use the Map History Viewer to view all data processed by Storm Center for a specific time range with full user interaction including information panels, panning, zooming, and outage summary reports.\nTo view historical map data:\nClick the Select Date and Time button at the top of the Map History Viewer. Use the calendar to select a date and time for which you want to view historical outage data. Click the Apply button. After you select a date and time, the top of the Map History Viewer will show a date and time range. This time range indicates the range of time for which a specific set of data was visible on the map views associated with the instance. For example, if one data set was generated on May 4, 2018 at 6:35 a.m., the next data set was generated at 6:50 a.m., and you select May 4, 2018 at 6:45 a.m., the Map History Viewer will show the time range “May 4, 2018 6:35 AM to 6:50 AM.”\nIf you select the latest data snapshot, the time range will be the date and time when the data was generated to “Present.”\nTo navigate from one time range to the time range before or after, you can click the arrow buttons to the right or left of the date and time range at the top of the Map History Viewer. If there is no data for the time range before or after the time range you are viewing, the arrow button or buttons will be disabled.\nConsider an example map with data sets generated on May 4, 2018 at 6:35 a.m., 6:50 a.m., 7:05 a.m., and 7:20 a.m. If you select May 4, 2018 at 7:00 a.m., the Map History Viewer will show the time range “May 4, 2018 6:50 AM to 7:05 AM.” If you then click the left arrow to view the previous time range, the Map History Viewer will show the time range “May 4, 2018 6:35 AM to 6:50 AM.” If you then click the right arrow twice, the Map History Viewer will show the time range “May 4, 2018 7:05 AM to 7:20 AM.”\nMap History Data Display The Map History Viewer shows data in information panels with generic data type labels such as “Incident ID,” “Affected,” and “Crew Status.” If a data type does not have a value for a specific outage and time range, that data type will not appear in the information panel for that outage.\nThe Map History Viewer does not show configured static values for null or expired Estimated Restoration Time (ETR). Instead, the Map History Viewer shows the exact ETR value from the outage data file for the selected time range. For null ETR values, the Map History Viewer does not show the ETR field in the information panel. For areas, the ETR shown in the Map History Viewer is the latest ETR for all outages affecting the area at the start of the selected time range. If all outages affecting an area have null ETR values, the ETR field in the summary report for that area will be blank.\nIf an instance has more than one map view and uses data field mapping for at least one map view, the Map History Viewer will show both the unmapped data values from the outage data feed and the mapped values. For each data type that can include mapping, the Map History Viewer shows the name of the data layer before the data value. Data layer names are created as part of the process to configure outage data layers.\nAll alert banners that were visible on any map views associated with the instance at the start of the selected time range will be shown as a list when you click the alert banner at the bottom of the map. The list of alert banners will show the name of the map view and the time associated with each alert banner. Map view names are created as part of the process to configure map views.\nAll custom layers items that were visible on map views associated with the instance at the start of the selected time range will be visible.\nIf an instance includes the Area Manager Control Center app and there were overwritten values for Estimated Restoration Time (ETR) and/or Customers Affected entered in the Area Manager app for one or more areas at the start of the selected time range, the Map History Viewer will show the overwritten values in the information panels and summary reports for those areas.\nMap History Bookmarks To create a bookmark:\nUse the Select Date and Time tool to select the date and time you want to bookmark. Click the Bookmarks button at the upper right of the Map History Viewer. Click the Add New Bookmark button. Enter a name for the bookmark. The date and time you are bookmarking is shown below the name field. Click the Save button. To view a bookmark:\nClick the Bookmarks button at the upper right of the Map History Viewer. Click the name of the bookmark you want to view. The date and time range for the bookmark will appear at the top of the Map History Viewer. To edit a bookmark name:\nClick the Bookmarks button at the upper right of the Map History Viewer. Click the pencil icon to the right of the bookmark you want to edit. Enter a new name for the bookmark. To save your changes, click the checkmark icon. To discard your changes, click the X icon. To delete a bookmark:\nClick the Bookmarks button at the upper right of the Map History Viewer. Click the trash can icon to the right of the bookmark you want to delete. Configuration Configuration for the Map History module is managed from the Settings section of the Map History app. There are five types of configurations:\nThematic Ranges Outage Ranges Service Territory Default Styling Timezone Configuration To access the Map History settings:\nNavigate to the Instance Manager website. Sign in using Google or other single sign-on credentials. Choose a tenant - this option is only presented if you have access to more than one tenant. Choose the Map History application. Choose a Storm Center instance. Choose the Settings option on the left side of the screen. After you make and save changes in the Map History settings, you must reload the web page to see the changes in the Map History Viewer.\nThematic Ranges For each area type associated with the selected instance, you can configure up to five thematic ranges with start and end values for number of customers affected, a color, and an opacity percentage to be used on the Map History Viewer.\nSelect the Thematic Ranges option from the Layer Styles list. Select an area type from the Thematics drop-down list. Enter the start and end values for customers affected for the range. Select a color for the thematic range from the Color drop-down list.

Messages are removed from the queue when the file is pulled for processing, so a backlog of messages indicates an issue with file processing. KUBRA support receives the alarm message.\nDelivery Node File Processing Queue Monitor This monitor triggers an alarm if there are more than 5 messages indicating a delivery node file was successfully uploaded in the data feeds queue. Messages are removed from the queue when the file is pulled for processing, so a backlog of messages indicates an issue with file processing. KUBRA support receives the alarm message.\nPlanned Outage File Processing Queue Monitor This monitor triggers an alarm if there are more than 20 messages indicating a planned outage file was successfully uploaded in the data feeds queue. Messages are removed from the queue when the file is pulled for processing, so a backlog of messages indicates an issue with file processing.

The other function of this monitor looks for batch jobs running for more than 120 minutes and terminates the job. The second function also sends an alert message to KUBRA support.\nRecent Outage Jobs Monitor This end-to-end monitor checks if the tenant has recent successful outage jobs. By default, if no jobs have completed successfully in the last 20 minutes, the monitor sends a warning message to KUBRA support. If no jobs have completed successfully after 30 minutes, the monitor sends an alert message to KUBRA support. KUBRA support sets thresholds for warning and alert messages for each tenant (utility).\nThe monitor also returns an error if the API is down and creates an alert for KUBRA support.",

If the deployed instance is up to date with the current configurations in the Instance Manager, you will see a green check mark icon next to Deployment Up-to-Date under the instance status.\nIf there are undeployed changes to the instance configuration, you can deploy them using the Deploy Manager page tools.\nEmbedding Outage Map Pages When an organization uses an iframe to embed a Storm Center outage map in an organization-controlled website, the organization should not use a meta tag such as \u003cmeta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=10\"\u003e. Attempting to use content=\"IE=10\" will cause the outage map page to return an error message. MS Edge will automatically use the latest browser version to render content without a compatibility meta tag.\nIf an organization sets up a CNAME for a Storm Center map and also wants to embed the map in a different web page or other application, the full-screen map web page and the iframe or div element for the embedded map must use the same URL. KUBRA recommends that users only access the outage map page from the CNAME URL after the CNAME is set up.\nInactivity Timeout By default, users of Instance Manager and Control Center will be logged out after 15 minutes of inactivity. By default, users of any map views with access restrictions will be logged out after 2 hours of inactivity.\nInconsistent Customers Affected Count There are three possible reasons why the number of customers affected in a summary report and the number of customers affected in the overview panel may not match.\nIf the thematic file used for a report is not used to filter delivery nodes and the thematic areas do not cover the entire region or service territory. This means there may be some delivery nodes that are included in the areas for the thematic file used to filter delivery nodes but are outside the areas in the thematic file for the report. If one or more of the delivery nodes is filtered due to spatial scanning or because the area name does not match any of the provided area names in the thematic file used to filter delivery nodes. If a user has entered an overwritten value for customers affected in the Area Manager app. Overwritten values are used for summary reports and information panels, but not for the summary in the overview panel. Known Issues When a user first accesses the map or changes the language on the map in the Microsoft Edge browser with the LastPass browser extension installed, the map breaks until the user reloads the web page. This issue also affects the Custom Layers tool. Possible solutions include uninstalling the LastPass extension or using a different browser. Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers are unaffected, even with the LastPass extension. - Reported February 1, 2018",
