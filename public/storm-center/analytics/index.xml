    <description>KUBRA uses Google Analytics Universal (GAU) and Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to track information about how users interact with Storm Center maps. These Analytics tools collect information from the map web page such as button clicks and anonymous information from the userâ€™s browser such as language preference, browser version, and the device and operating system type.&#xA;GAU and GA4 data from Storm Center maps helps KUBRA improve the map interface, optimize the data flow, and help organizations providing Storm Center maps to their customers to understand how those customers are using the map.</description>
